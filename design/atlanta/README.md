## Routes

1. **Neon Pulse Grid**
- Closest to current direction.
- Best if we want a fast refresh without large structural changes.

2. **Editorial Club Poster**
- Strongest brand personality.
- Best if we want ATL to feel cultural and memorable first, utility second.

3. **Civic Night Atlas**
- Most balanced and scalable.
- Best if we need nightlife, festivals, and community modules to feel unified.

## Recommendation

If we optimize for immediate launch quality with minimal rework, start with **Route A**.
If we optimize for brand distinctiveness in a crowded events market, push **Route B**.
If we optimize for long-term platform clarity across mixed content types, choose **Route C**.

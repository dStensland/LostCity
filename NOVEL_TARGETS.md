# Novel B2B Target Segments for LostCity

These 15 segments go beyond the obvious targets (hotels, tourism boards, publications). Each represents a specific pain point where LostCity creates measurable business value.

---

## 1. Luxury Apartment Complexes & Property Managers

**Atlanta Targets:**
- Atlantic House Midtown, Nine15 Midtown, The Huntley, The Dagny
- MAA Communities (portfolio of 15+ Atlanta properties)
- Cortland Partners, Gables Residential, Camden Property Trust
- High-rise properties in Midtown, Buckhead, Old Fourth Ward, West Midtown

**Pain Point:**
Concierge staff burn $40-60k/year manually googling "things to do this weekend" for residents. Stale printed neighborhood guides sit in lobbies unused. Resident turnover costs $1-5k per lost tenant, and "didn't feel connected to the neighborhood" is a top reason people don't renew.

**Portal:**
Branded "[Property Name] Neighborhood Guide" with:
- Walking distance filter (0.5mi / 1mi / 2mi from property)
- Resident interest profiles ("Date Night", "Fitness Enthusiast", "Foodie", "New to Atlanta")
- Weekly email digest: "This Week Around [Property]"
- Presets: "Date Night Under $50", "Sunday Funday", "Meet the Neighbors"
- Print-friendly monthly calendar for lobby display

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $300-800/mo per property (Class A properties with full-time concierge)
- $3-5k/mo for portfolio license (10+ properties)
- ROI pitch: preventing ONE lost tenant pays for 2-6 months

**How to Get In:**
- Target Director of Resident Experience or Community Manager
- Multifamily Housing Summit and NAAEI conferences
- Cold outreach: "I noticed [Property] promotes 'urban lifestyle' but your website's neighborhood guide was last updated in 2022..."
- Offer: free 90-day pilot, co-branded launch event for residents

---

## 2. Corporate Relocation Services & Real Estate Brokerages

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Relocation:** Suddath, SIRVA, Graebel Atlanta, WHR Group
- **Brokerages:** BHGRE Metro Brokers, Harry Norman Realtors, Berkshire Hathaway GA, Dorsey Alston, Ansley Real Estate

**Pain Point:**
25% of corporate relocations fail within 2 years, often due to "lifestyle fit" issues. Real estate agents spend 10-15 hours per client manually creating neighborhood guides and restaurant recommendations. The spouse/partner who didn't choose the move is the #1 relocation failure factor.

**Portal:**
- Personalized "Welcome to [Buyer Name]'s Atlanta" based on family type, interests, budget
- Neighborhood comparison tool: compare 3-4 neighborhoods' event scenes side-by-side
- 90-day onboarding email series: Week 1 = grocery/essentials, Week 2 = weekend exploration, etc.
- Agent dashboard to track client engagement ("they clicked on Decatur breweries 8 times")
- "Spouse Edition" for the trailing partner

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $150-400/mo for boutique brokerages (10-30 agents)
- $1,500-3k/mo for large firms (100+ agents)
- Alternative: $25-50 per relocation as usage-based pricing

**How to Get In:**
- Pitch as client retention tool, not marketing expense
- "Your clients love you during the home search. They forget you 3 months later. Stay top-of-mind for 90 days."
- Offer: free pilot for next 10 relocations, agent keeps 100% credit
- Present at brokerage sales meetings

---

## 3. University Student Life & Orientation

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Major universities:** Emory (15k students), Georgia Tech (45k), Georgia State (52k)
- **HBCUs:** Morehouse, Spelman, Clark Atlanta, Morris Brown
- **AUC Consortium** (4 HBCUs, 10k+ students, shared orientation)
- Kennesaw State, Oglethorpe, Agnes Scott

**Pain Point:**
30% of freshmen cite "didn't fit in socially" as reason for transferring (= $40-60k lost tuition). Student life offices hand out static PDF "Atlanta guides" that are outdated by October. International students and out-of-state freshmen struggle to build social connections beyond campus.

**Portal:**
- Branded "[University] + Atlanta" guide in student portal
- Filters: "Free & Under $20", "MARTA-accessible", "Student discount", "21+ / All-ages"
- Orientation integration: "Atlanta Passport Challenge" (gamified checklist, prize for visiting 10 places)
- Parent version for Family Weekend: "Things to Do with Your Student"
- Resident Advisor dashboard for floor bonding activities

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $1,500-3,500/mo for large universities (20k+ students)
- $500-1,200/mo for smaller schools (5-10k students)
- One-time setup fee: $5-10k for custom branding/orientation integration
- ROI pitch: retaining ONE student pays for 1-2 years

**How to Get In:**
- Dean of Students or Director of Student Life (not IT)
- Retention ROI angle: "Your orientation week is great. What about weeks 2-52?"
- NASPA (Student Affairs Administrators) conferences
- Start with smaller schools (Agnes Scott, Oglethorpe) for case studies, then approach Emory/Tech

---

## 4. Corporate HR Platforms & Employee Benefits Providers

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Benefits platforms:** Fringe Benefits, Compt, SnackNation, PerkSpot
- **HR consultancies:** OneDigital Atlanta, Gallagher, Sequoia, The Benefit Companies
- **Enterprise HR:** Delta, Coca-Cola, UPS, Home Depot, SunTrust/Truist (direct sales)

**Pain Point:**
90% of companies offer wellness or lifestyle stipends, but utilization is only 30-40%. Employees get $50/month for "wellness" but don't know where to spend it locally. HR teams want engagement metrics but have no way to track local lifestyle usage.

**Portal:**
- White-labeled inside benefits dashboard (Compt, Fringe, etc.)
- "Use Your Wellness Stipend This Week" personalized suggestions
- Manager view: "Team Building Ideas Under $200"
- Wellness categories: active/outdoor, arts/culture, relaxation, learning
- Usage tracking for HR: "23% of employees redeemed wellness benefits locally this month"

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $2-5k/mo for platforms like Compt/Fringe (they resell to thousands of companies)
- $500-2k/mo for direct-to-enterprise HR (1,000+ employees)
- Usage-based: $2-5 per employee per month
- Platform play is 10x more scalable than direct enterprise sales

**How to Get In:**
- **For platforms:** B2B partnership pitch: "We power the 'local experiences' category for your benefits marketplace"
- **For direct enterprise:** "Your wellness program has a 68% problem" (show national avg utilization)
- SHRM Atlanta chapter events
- Start with Fringe or Compt (both have Atlanta presence), prove model, then scale

---

## 5. Senior Living Communities

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Independent/assisted living:** Lenbrook, Canterbury Court, Heartis Buckhead, Lenbrook Square
- **Continuing care:** King'sBridge Retirement Community, Wesley Woods
- **Active adult 55+:** Del Webb at Lake Oconee, Peachtree Hills Place, Windsong

**Pain Point:**
Activity Directors spend 20+ hours/week researching and planning outings. Residents complain "there's nothing to do" (major churn risk when entrance fees are $200k+). Families choosing communities ask "will Mom be engaged?" Transportation logistics are a nightmare.

**Portal:**
- Branded "[Community] Adventures" (NOT "senior activities" — stigma)
- Filters: wheelchair-accessible, matinee times, no stairs, group-friendly (10+ people)
- Print-friendly monthly calendar (many residents don't use apps)
- "Bring the Grandkids" filter for family visit weekends
- Activity Director backend: one-click export to newsletter, track resident preferences

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $400-1,200/mo per community
- Higher end for CCRC (continuing care) with 200+ residents
- ROI pitch: retention is everything when entrance fees are $200k+

**How to Get In:**
- Executive Director or Director of Resident Life
- Offer to present at resident council meeting (let residents vote on it)
- "Your Activity Director is drowning. What if planning outings took 2 hours instead of 20?"
- Start with one community, get testimonial, scale to chains

---

## 6. Coworking Spaces & Private Members Clubs

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Coworking:** The LOLA, Roam, Serendipity Labs Buckhead, Switchyards, CreateATL
- **Members clubs:** The Gathering Spot, Capital City Club (younger tier), Commerce Club
- WeWork Atlanta (4 locations, but dying brand)

**Pain Point:**
70% of coworking revenue comes from events/community, not desk rentals. Member churn costs $3-5k to replace (acquisition + lost revenue). Members join for "community" but 60% never attend an event. New members ask "what should I do after work?"

**Portal:**
- Branded "[Space] Member Perks" guide
- Filters: networking events, after-work happy hours, weekend activities, member discounts
- Host can add their own in-house events to the same feed
- Member directory integration: "3 other members are going to this"
- Weekly digest: "Where Members Are Going This Week"

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $300-800/mo for single location (100-300 members)
- $1,500-3k/mo for multi-location operators (3+ spaces)
- Alternative: $3-5 per member per month

**How to Get In:**
- Target Community Manager or Director of Member Experience
- The LOLA first (founder Cate Stallings is a networker, great case study potential)
- Pitch: "Your members pay for community. We help them find it outside your four walls."
- Offer: co-host a "Members Explore Atlanta" event to launch

---

## 7. Wedding Planners & Bridal Concierge Services

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Planners:** Soiree South, Event Productions by Gen, Leigh & Co Events, London Pierre Events
- **Venues with planning:** The Estate, Summerour Studio, Biltmore Ballrooms
- **Platforms:** Engaged Atlanta, WeddingWire Local (partnership play)

**Pain Point:**
60-70% of wedding guests are out-of-town and ask "what should we do Friday/Sunday?" Planners spend 5-10 hours per wedding creating custom itineraries for the couple + guests. Couples want to show off their city but don't have time to research.

**Portal:**
- Guest-facing microsite: "[Couple Names] Atlanta Wedding Weekend"
- Prebuilt itineraries: Friday rehearsal dinner neighborhoods, Saturday recovery brunch, Sunday exploration
- Filters by guest type: "Family-friendly", "Party crew", "First-timers"
- Planner backend: duplicate template, customize per wedding, white-label

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $100-300/mo for individual planners (12-30 weddings/year)
- $800-2k/mo for planning firms (100+ weddings/year)
- Alternative: $50-100 per wedding (usage-based)

**How to Get In:**
- Atlanta Wedding Expos (target planners, not couples)
- "You spend 10 hours creating guest guides. What if it took 10 minutes?"
- Offer: free for next 3 weddings, planner keeps 100% branding credit
- Start with boutique planners (more pain, faster decision), scale to volume firms

---

## 8. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Airport

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Concessions operator:** Paradies Lagardere (167 F&B outlets + 140 retail stores at ATL)
- **Airport hotels:** Marriott Gateway, Hilton Atlanta Airport, Westin Airport
- **Airlines:** Delta Sky Club (partnership, see separate segment)
- **ATLDOT (airport authority):** digital signage, app integration

**Pain Point:**
108 million passengers/year with average 1-2 hour dwell time. Business travelers with 4-6 hour layovers don't know they can leave the airport, explore, and return. Airport spends $60M on advertising but lacks local content. New T-gates expansion needs wayfinding content.

**Portal:**
- "Atlanta Layover Guide" with time-based filters: 2hr, 4hr, 6hr, overnight
- MARTA-accessible only (security re-entry time calculated)
- Digital screen integration: "You have 4 hours. Here's what's happening in Midtown right now."
- Airport hotel partnerships: "Land Early, Stay Late" itineraries
- TSA Pre/Clear users get extended time recommendations

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $3-8k/mo for airport-wide digital screen content
- $500-1,500/mo per airport hotel for guest-facing guide
- $10-25k/mo for airline partnership (Delta, Southwest)
- Alternative: Paradies Lagardere just signed 10-year, $60M advertising rights deal — they need content

**How to Get In:**
- Dual approach:
  1. **Paradies Lagardere** (concessionaire with ad rights) — content partnership
  2. **ATLDOT Innovation Team** — app/digital signage integration
- World Cup 2026 angle: "Atlanta will host 6+ matches. What do visiting fans do between games?"
- Start with hotel partnerships (easier sale), use as proof for airport authority

---

## 9. Fitness Studios & Boutique Gyms

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Multi-location boutique:** The Fitness Collective (4 locations), Onelife Fitness, CycleBar Atlanta
- **Premium studios:** Barry's Bootcamp, SoulCycle, Orangetheory (8 ATL locations), Pure Barre
- **Yoga/recovery:** YogaSix, StretchLab, Restore Hyper Wellness

**Pain Point:**
Member churn costs $200-400 to replace. Studios spend 61% of their marketing budget on events and "community building" but lack tools. Members join for fitness, stay for community — but 70% never attend social events. "Wellness lifestyle" is a selling point but studios only offer workouts.

**Portal:**
- Branded "[Studio] Wellness Community" guide
- Filters: active/outdoor events, healthy dining, yoga/meditation, recovery/spa, sports leagues
- Member social feature: "4 members are going to this farmers market"
- Studio dashboard: track member engagement, see what members like outside the studio
- Weekly digest: "Fuel Your Fitness" (recovery, nutrition, active events)

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $200-500/mo for single studio (200-500 members)
- $1-2.5k/mo for multi-location operators (3+ studios)
- ROI pitch: retaining 2-3 members/month pays for itself

**How to Get In:**
- Target Studio Manager or Regional Director
- The Fitness Collective first (local, 4 locations, community-focused brand)
- Pitch: "Your retention strategy is 'send more emails.' What if you became their lifestyle hub?"
- Offer: co-host "Studio Members Adventure Day" to launch

---

## 10. After-School Programs & Youth Organizations

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **City programs:** City of Atlanta Centers of Hope (18 locations), Park Pride
- **YMCA:** YMCA of Metro Atlanta (12 locations, 15k+ youth members)
- **Youth orgs:** Agape Youth & Family Center, @Promise Centers (Atlanta Public Schools), Boys & Girls Clubs Metro Atlanta
- **Cultural:** Marcus Jewish Community Center, Latin American Association

**Pain Point:**
2-5 staff members serving 50-500 youth. "Field Trip Friday" requires 10+ hours/week of research (safe, age-appropriate, free/low-cost, educational). Grant funding increasingly requires "community integration" and "cultural exposure" outcomes with measurable data.

**Portal:**
- Filters: safe/supervised, age-appropriate (by grade level), free/under $10, educational value tags
- Weekly calendar builder: drag-and-drop to plan month of field trips
- Outcome tracking for grants: "Our youth attended 47 cultural events this year across 12 neighborhoods"
- Partnership with venues: "School group discount" tags
- Print-friendly permission slip generator

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $150-400/mo for small programs (1-2 sites, 50-200 youth)
- $500-1,200/mo for large orgs (5+ sites, 500+ youth)
- $2-4k/mo for city-wide networks (Centers of Hope, APS @Promise)
- Grant angle: "This tool helps you meet your funder's community integration metrics"

**How to Get In:**
- Target Program Director or Director of Youth Services
- "You're judged on outcomes but spend all your time planning logistics. What if planning took 30 minutes?"
- Pitch as equity tool: "Every kid deserves to explore their city, not just the ones whose parents have time to research"
- Start with one Center of Hope or YMCA, scale via network effect

---

## 11. MARTA & Transit Advertising

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **MARTA directly:** IT/Digital Experience team, Marketing
- **Ad partner:** Intersection Media (10-year contract, deploying 200+ digital screens across MARTA system)
- **MARTA Planning:** NextGen Bus network overhaul (April 2026 launch)

**Pain Point:**
MARTA needs content for 200 new digital screens across rail stations + 500 buses. NextGen Bus redesign requires rider-facing tools to drive adoption. World Cup 2026 prep: international visitors need transit + destination integration. Current "where MARTA takes you" messaging is generic.

**Portal:**
- **Public tool:** "Where MARTA Takes You" — discovery by station/line/neighborhood
- **Digital screens:** Station-based event feeds ("Happening near this station today")
- **MARTA app integration:** "You're at Five Points. Here's what's happening within 0.5mi"
- **Trip planner:** "I want to see live music in East Atlanta" → MARTA route suggestions
- World Cup mode: multi-language, stadium event integration

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $3-8k/mo for digital screen content (sell to Intersection Media, not MARTA)
- $10-20k/mo for full MARTA app integration
- Alternative: Rev share on affiliate revenue from "near this station" recommendations

**How to Get In:**
- **Dual approach:**
  1. **Intersection Media** (200 screens going live NOW, desperate for content)
  2. **MARTA IT/Innovation** (app integration, longer sales cycle)
- World Cup 2026 angle: "You have 18 months to show the world MARTA isn't just transportation"
- NextGen Bus angle: "You're redesigning routes. Help riders discover what's newly accessible."
- Start with Intersection for quick win, use traction to approach MARTA

## 12. Corporate Campus Food Service & Amenity Providers

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Food service operators:** Aramark, Sodexo, Compass Group serving:
  - Delta HQ (12k employees, campus in Midtown)
  - Coca-Cola HQ (4k employees, campus near Georgia Tech)
  - Georgia Tech campus dining (45k students/staff)
  - Emory University (15k employees)
- **Corporate campuses:** UPS Sandy Springs, State Farm Dunwoody, Novelis

**Pain Point:**
Corporate campuses compete with remote work. "Return to office" mandates fail when campus is boring. Food service contracts include $1-10M amenity budgets but operators lack local engagement tools. Employers want "lifestyle perks" but don't know how to deliver them.

**Portal:**
- Branded "[Company] Explore Atlanta"
- Filters: lunch break adventures (30min / 1hr), after-work team outings, weekend exploration
- Manager dashboard: "Team building ideas near campus"
- New hire onboarding: "Welcome to Atlanta" (for relocations)
- Cafeteria digital screens: "This week near campus"

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $1-3k/mo for mid-size campuses (1,000-5,000 employees)
- $5-15k/mo for major HQs (10k+ employees: Delta, Coke, UPS)
- Alternative: partner with Aramark/Sodexo/Compass, they resell as value-add ($10-20k/mo to operators)

**How to Get In:**
- **For employers:** VP of Employee Experience or Chief People Officer
- **For food service:** VP of Client Services (they pitch to employers)
- "Your RTO mandate isn't working because your campus feels like a prison. What if it was a launchpad?"
- Start with food service operators (they serve 10+ campuses), not individual employers

---

## 13. Mixed-Use Developers & Placemaking

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Operating properties:**
  - Ponce City Market (Jamestown, 2M+ annual visitors)
  - The Battery Atlanta (CIM Group, 8M+ visitors, Braves anchor)
  - Atlantic Station (Hines, 18M+ visitors)
  - Avalon (North American Properties, 10M+ visitors)
  - The Interlock (Selig Enterprises, opening phases)
- **Developers with pipelines:** Portman Holdings, Jacoby Development, Columbia Residential

**Pain Point:**
Retail vacancy is an existential threat (e-commerce + COVID). Destinations survive on "experiential retail" (events > shopping). Marketing budgets are $500k-2M/year but lack dynamic content. Retail tenants demand foot traffic data. Leasing teams need "Live/Work/Play" proof points.

**Portal:**
- Branded "[Development] Destination Guide" (replaces static "What's Happening" pages)
- Tenant event promotion (retail/restaurant events appear automatically)
- "Live/Work/Play" module for leasing website (apartment tours)
- Analytics dashboard for tenants: "Your restaurant appeared in 1,247 searches this month"
- Corporate event partnerships: "Host your offsite at The Battery"

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $1,500-4k/mo for large properties (Ponce City Market, The Battery)
- $5-10k/mo for multi-property developers (Portman, Jacoby)
- Alternative: rev share on tenant leads or affiliate revenue

**How to Get In:**
- Target VP of Marketing or Director of Placemaking (title varies)
- Ponce City Market first (iconic, data-driven, 2M+ visitors)
- "Your 'What's Happening' page was last updated 3 weeks ago. What if it updated itself?"
- Retail tenant angle: "We drive foot traffic, you prove ROI to tenants"

---

## 14. Employee Relocation Platforms

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Relocation management platforms:** Weichert Workforce Mobility, Aires, UrbanBound, Cartus, SIRVA
- **Corporate relocation buyers:** Delta (relocates 2k+/year), Coca-Cola, Porsche NA, Norfolk Southern
- **Global mobility consultancies:** BGRS, Graebel, WHR Group

**Pain Point:**
$14 billion industry with 25% failure rate. Failed relocation costs employers $50-100k (moving costs + replacement hire + lost productivity). Spouse/partner adjustment is #1 reason relocations fail. Platforms offer logistics (moving, housing) but zero lifestyle integration.

**Portal:**
- Personalized onboarding by employee profile (family type, interests, budget, neighborhood)
- 90-day journey: Week 1 = essentials, Week 4 = exploration, Week 12 = "you're a local now"
- Spouse/partner version (trailing spouse gets separate, personalized guide)
- Neighborhood selection tool for pre-move research
- Employer dashboard: "87% of relocated employees engaged with local guide in first 90 days"

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $5-15k/mo for platforms (Aires, UrbanBound, Cartus) — they resell to hundreds of employers
- Alternative: $2-5 per relocation (usage-based, lower friction)
- Platform play is 100x more scalable than selling to individual employers

**How to Get In:**
- **Sell to platforms, not employers** (one deal = thousands of relocations)
- Worldwide ERC (Employee Relocation Council) conferences
- "Your clients spend $50k moving bodies. What if you moved lives?"
- Pilot: integrate with one platform (UrbanBound is most tech-forward), prove retention lift

---

## 15. Airline Loyalty Programs & Travel Platforms

**Atlanta Targets:**
- **Delta SkyMiles:** 120M+ members, Atlanta is mega-hub (75% of ATL traffic)
- **Credit card travel platforms:** AmEx Travel, Chase Sapphire, Capital One Travel (Venture X)
- **Travel booking:** Expedia Local Experiences, Airbnb Experiences (partnership)

**Pain Point:**
Loyalty programs face commoditization ("everyone has miles"). "Local experiences" is fastest-growing redemption category but airlines lack local content infrastructure. Delta has 120M members but no way to monetize them on the ground in Atlanta. Credit card platforms want "unique redemptions" to justify annual fees.

**Portal:**
- **Delta SkyMiles integration:** Redeem miles for event tickets (concert = 15k miles, museum = 5k miles)
- **Layover mode:** "You have 6 hours at ATL. Leave the airport." (MARTA integration)
- **Tier-based access:** Diamond Medallion gets early access to sold-out events
- **Credit card platform:** "Redeem points for local experiences" (Chase Sapphire Reserve, AmEx Platinum)
- **Affiliate revenue:** Delta gets 10-15% of ticket sales driven by their app

**Willingness to Pay:**
- $10-30k/mo for Delta integration (volume justifies investment)
- $5-15k/mo for credit card platforms (AmEx, Chase, Capital One)
- Alternative: rev share on miles redeemed (lower upfront, higher long-term)

**How to Get In:**
- **Delta:** VP of Customer Engagement & Loyalty (not IT, not marketing)
- World Cup 2026 angle: "Atlanta hosts 6+ matches. Delta flies the world here. What do they do between games?"
- "SkyMiles are a currency with no local spending. We're the merchant network."
- **Credit cards:** Partnership team at Chase/AmEx (they white-label experiences)

---

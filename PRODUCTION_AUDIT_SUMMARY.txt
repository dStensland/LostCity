LOSTCITY PRODUCTION AUDIT - QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================
Date: 2026-02-16
Health Score: 90.4/100
Status: READY WITH MINOR ISSUES

CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES (Must fix before production)
================================================================================

1. VENUES MISSING COORDINATES (343 venues)
   Impact: Can't show on maps
   Fix: python3 venue_enrich.py --missing-coords-only
   Time: 1-2 hours

2. ALL CAPS SHORT TITLES (420 events)
   Impact: Poor UX, bad SEO
   Sources: the-eastern, the-masquerade, terminal-west
   Fix: Add title normalization in db.py insert_event()
   Time: 30 minutes

3. DEAD SOURCES (194 sources, 35% of active)
   Impact: Wastes crawler time
   Fix: Set is_active=false for broken sources
   Time: 1 hour manual review

HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Fix before public launch)
================================================================================

4. MUSIC EVENTS WITHOUT GENRES (971 events, 38% of music)
   Sources: ticketmaster (215), the-earl (87), eventbrite (64)
   Fix: Run artist_images.py + enhance tag_inference.py
   Time: 2-3 hours

5. NULL DESCRIPTIONS (882 events, 4.8%)
   Sources: ticketmaster (118), meetup (95), eventbrite (87)
   Fix: Enable LLM extraction, add fallback descriptions
   Time: 2 hours

6. CROSS-MIDNIGHT TIME BUG (119 events)
   Source: ten-atlanta (all 119 events)
   Fix: Handle end_time < start_time in crawler
   Time: 30 minutes

MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (Polish for UX)
================================================================================

7. DATE IN TITLE (105 events)
   Sources: ebenezer-church, meetup, zoo-atlanta, schr
   Fix: Add title cleaning regex in db.py
   Time: 15 minutes

8. TITLE = VENUE NAME (34 events)
   Source: farmers-markets, freedom-farmers-market
   Fix: Update crawlers to capture event name, not venue name
   Time: 30 minutes

9. NIGHTLIFE WITHOUT GENRES (159 events)
   Fix: Add nightlife genre inference in tag_inference.py
   Time: 1 hour

10. SYNTHETIC DESCRIPTIONS (104 events)
    Description: "Event at X."
    Fix: Better fallback descriptions using venue+category
    Time: 30 minutes

PASS / LOW PRIORITY
================================================================================
✓ Duplicate Events: 0 found
✓ Relationship Integrity: All foreign keys valid
○ Duplicate Hashes: 21 (Masquerade venue variants - cosmetic)
○ Category Distribution: 2 underdeveloped categories (dance, religious)

QUICK FIXES TO RUN NOW
================================================================================

1. Title normalization in db.py (30 min):
   - Strip date prefixes: r'^(January|February|...|December)\s+\d+:\s*'
   - Normalize ALL CAPS short titles to title case
   - Decode HTML entities: html.unescape()
   - Reject title = venue name

2. Fix ten-atlanta.py cross-midnight (15 min):
   if end_time and start_time and end_time < start_time:
       end_time = None

3. Deactivate dead sources (1 hour):
   UPDATE sources SET is_active = false WHERE slug IN (
       'basement-atlanta', 'keep-atlanta-beautiful', 'vista-yoga',
       'flux-projects', 'my-parents-basement', 'tongue-and-groove',
       'cdc-museum', 'clark-atlanta-art-museum', ...
   );

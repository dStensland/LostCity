# Emory Demo Run 001

## Scope Lock

- Client: Emory Healthcare
- Vertical: Hospital
- Portal slug: `emory-demo`
- Positioning: Community resource and location guide
- Out of scope: clinical triage, care coordination, medical advice, PHI workflows
- Wayfinding partner: Gozio
- Competitor exclusions: Piedmont and competitor-owned health-system content

## Persona Priority

1. Visitor or caregiver
2. Out-of-town family
3. Patient logistics (non-clinical)
4. Staff shift
5. Community health seeker

## Unified UX Contract

- One IA and component system for all personas.
- Persona changes affect mode default, CTA priority, and ranked content.
- Primary actions: book visit, directions, services.
- Attribution and trust context always visible at the decision point.

## Source Contract (Current)

- Tier 1: Emory operations, CDC, Georgia DPH, county public health
- Tier 2: nonprofit and civic support (ACFB, Open Hand, Red Cross, parks, YMCA)
- Exclusions enforced for competitor systems

## First Quality Gate Check

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Brand fidelity | In progress | Emory visual system in place; refine final polish against reference benchmark |
| Action clarity | Pass | Action rail and hero CTA stack now explicit and consistent |
| Attribution integrity | In progress | Provenance visible on curated layers, continue tightening across feed cards |
| Persona coherence | Pass | Persona defaults and labels wired through feed, directory, and hospital pages |
| Mobile quality | In progress | Core flows improved; continue overlap and spacing checks |
| Scope guardrail | Pass | No clinical guidance surfaces added |

## Next Iteration Focus

1. Replace remaining generic/literal copy with concrete Emory-specific examples.
2. Tighten typography rhythm and spacing hierarchy to Emory-first editorial polish.
3. Complete provenance microcopy pass on all card variants.
4. Add screenshot-based quality gate evidence for desktop and mobile.

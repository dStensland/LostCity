# Portal Factory System

This system standardizes how Lost City builds white-label portals with radical customization and shared platform leverage.

## Outcomes

1. Brand-native experience quality that feels first-party to each client.
2. Persona-adaptive journeys on a unified design and interaction system.
3. Strict provenance and attribution by default.
4. Repeatable delivery with measurable launch proof.

## Operating Sequence

1. `00-portal-intake.md`
2. `01-persona-outcome-matrix.md`
3. `02-source-attribution-contract.md`
4. `03-design-system-brief.md`
5. `04-quality-gate-scorecard.md`
6. `05-launch-hypothesis-dashboard.md`

## Core Rule

One design system per client portal. Persona differences adjust action priority, defaults, ranking, and message emphasis, not visual quality.

## Vertical Invariants

- Shared architecture planes remain constant: Federation, Experience, Trust, Insight.
- Security and tenant isolation are non-negotiable.
- Attribution must be visible where decisions are made.

## Client Variability Layer

- Brand expression (tokens, voice, interaction tone)
- Persona weighting
- Source packs and exclusions
- Primary action semantics and partner integrations
- KPI definitions and commercial proof framing

## Feedback Learning Loop

Every review issue must map to:

1. Immediate product fix.
2. Root process failure.
3. Permanent template/checklist update.

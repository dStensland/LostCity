# Hidden Atlanta: Deep Cultural Research Guide

**Mission:** Find genuinely hidden, non-obvious cultural experiences in Atlanta metro that a savvy local would NOT already know. These are active subcultures, scenes, and communities that exist but aren't on tourist maps.

**Current Problem:** Our "Midnight Train" (weird spots) track and general explore tracks feature places that locals already know: Tabernacle, Krog Street Tunnel, Piedmont Park, Clermont Lounge, etc. We need the REAL underground.

## Quality Criteria for "Hidden" Designation

A venue/event qualifies as genuinely hidden if:

1. **Not on tourist maps** - Won't appear in Discover Atlanta, Visit Atlanta
2. **Locals-only knowledge** - You'd need an insider to tell you about it
3. **Active subculture** - Real community, not manufactured "quirky"
4. **Requires seeking out** - Not on main streets, not heavily advertised
5. **Authentic scene** - Has been operating for years, real cultural value

Does NOT qualify as hidden:
- Ponce City Market (too famous)
- Krog Street Tunnel (literally on every Atlanta list)
- The Vortex (iconic but well-known)
- Oakland Cemetery (beautiful but not underground)
- BeltLine murals (main tourist draw now)

---

## Output Format for Each Find

When documenting discoveries, use this format:

```
**Venue Name**
- **Type:** [venue_type from taxonomy]
- **Location:** Full address, neighborhood
- **What it is:** 1-2 sentence description
- **Why it's hidden:** What makes it genuinely underground/non-obvious
- **Public events:** Yes/No, frequency
- **Website/Social:** URLs
- **Crawler priority:** Immediate/High/Medium/Research
- **Data quality:** Does it have lat/lng, photos, full address?
```

---

## Success Metrics

A successful hidden culture audit delivers:

1. **20+ new venues** that meet "genuinely hidden" criteria
2. **10+ active crawlers** for ongoing event discovery
3. **5+ ethnic/cultural enclaves** with specific venues
4. **3+ maker/hacker spaces** with public programming
5. **5+ DIY arts spaces** currently operating
6. **Coverage of 3+ active subcultures** (house music, punk, experimental, etc.)

---

## Notes on Data Integrity

Remember from `crawlers/CLAUDE.md`:

- **Never create events for permanent attractions**
- **Always crawl original sources, never curators**
- **Complete venue data is critical** - lat/lng, neighborhood, venue_type
- **Every crawler should ensure the venue is a destination** worth visiting regardless of events

From `web/CLAUDE.md`:
- All new venue/event data flows through crawlers → db.py → Supabase
- Frontend reads from Supabase, never writes venue data
- Service client for mutations, regular client for reads

---

## Next Steps

1. **Browser research session** - Run all web queries above
2. **Social media audit** - Check Instagram/Facebook for active communities
3. **Create new crawlers** - Start with Immediate priority list
4. **Verify existing** - Confirm Goat Farm, 404 Found, etc. are properly crawled
5. **Enrich venues** - Ensure all hidden spots have full data (images, coordinates, vibes)
6. **Tag appropriately** - Use explore_category = "hidden_gems" where appropriate
7. **Build "Hidden Atlanta" track** - Or enhance "Midnight Train" with truly obscure picks

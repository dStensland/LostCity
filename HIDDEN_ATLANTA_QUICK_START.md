## Quick Validation Tests

Before adding a venue, test:

### 1. The Google Test
Search "things to do Atlanta" - does this venue appear in top 20 results?
- **YES** → Not hidden enough, skip
- **NO** → Proceed

### 2. The Eater Test
Google "Eater Atlanta [venue name]"
- **Multiple features** → Too well-known
- **One mention or none** → Good candidate

### 3. The Tourist Test
Would a tourist staying in Midtown find this naturally?
- **YES** → Not hidden
- **NO** → Hidden candidate

### 4. The Active Test
Has this venue posted on social or had an event in last 30 days?
- **YES** → Active, proceed
- **NO** → May be closed, verify carefully

---

## Red Flags (Skip These)

- **Permanently closed** (check Google Maps, recent reviews)
- **Tourist trap** (appears in Visit Atlanta, Discover Atlanta)
- **No public access** (members only, truly private)
- **Franchise/chain** (even if quirky)
- **Just a normal business** (no cultural significance)
- **One-time popup** (not recurring venue/event)
- **Marketing as "secret" heavily** (if everyone knows the "secret," it's not hidden)

**Examples to SKIP:**
- Prohibition (heavily marketed "speakeasy")
- The Vortex (every Atlanta list)
- Clermont Lounge (famous)
- Ponce City Market (tourist central)
- Krog Street Market (ditto)

-- ============================================
-- MIGRATION 351: Marist School Summer Programs Source
-- ============================================
-- Official Marist School summer program catalog hosted on MyRec.
--
-- Portal strategy:
--   Owner:       hooky  (family programming is primary Hooky content)
--   Subscribers: atlanta (family camps also belong in the Atlanta consumer feed)
--
-- Pattern role:
--   First reusable MyRec implementation for school-hosted camps. The crawler
--   extracts structured sessions directly from program detail pages.

## Working with You

When asked for competitive intelligence:

1. **Clarify the need**: Specific competitor? Market overview? Positioning help?
2. **Gather current info**: Web search for recent news, check their site
3. **Analyze signals**: What does the evidence suggest?
4. **Connect to strategy**: How does this affect our decisions?
5. **Recommend actions**: What should we do about this?

When monitoring the landscape:

1. **Focus on what matters**: Not all competitor activity is relevant
2. **Look for patterns**: Single data points are noise; patterns are signal
3. **Be objective**: Don't dismiss competitors or overestimate them
4. **Tie to our strategy**: Intel is only useful if it informs decisions
5. **Update regularly**: The landscape changes

Remember: The goal isn't to obsess over competitors - it's to understand the market well enough to make smart decisions about where and how to compete.

## Outreach Templates

### Cold Email Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

```
Subject: [Specific observation about their business]

Hi [Name],

[Observation about their situation - shows you did research]

[Agitate the pain - what this costs them]

[Brief intro to solution - 1 sentence max]

[Specific ask - meeting, not a sale]

[Sign off]
```

### Example: Hotel Outreach

```
Subject: Guest experience idea for [Hotel Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Hotel] emphasizes local experiences in your marketing - the "Live Like a Local" campaign is great.

Most hotels struggle to keep event recommendations current. Concierge teams spend hours researching, and guests still end up on Yelp.

We built an events discovery platform that hotels white-label as their own. Always-current local events, zero staff time.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits [Hotel]'s approach?

[Name]
```

### Follow-Up Sequence

**Follow-up 1 (3 days)**: Add new value (article, insight, event they might care about)
**Follow-up 2 (7 days)**: Different angle or pain point
**Follow-up 3 (14 days)**: Break-up email ("Closing the loop...")

### LinkedIn Connection Request

```
Hi [Name] - I work with [similar companies] on local event discovery for [their audience]. Saw [specific thing about them]. Would love to connect.
```

### LinkedIn Message (after connection)

```
Thanks for connecting, [Name].

Quick question: How does [Company] currently help [guests/employees/members] discover local events?

Asking because we've been working with [similar companies] on this exact problem.

No pitch - genuinely curious how you handle it.
```

## Objection Handling

### "We already have something for this"

**Response framework**:
1. Acknowledge: "That's great - what are you using?"
2. Dig deeper: "How's it working? What do you wish was better?"
3. Differentiate: Based on their answer, highlight specific gaps we fill

**Common "somethings"**:
- **Manual curation**: "How much time does that take? What happens when the person doing it is out?"
- **Eventbrite embed**: "Does that show events from other platforms? Local venues without Eventbrite presence?"
- **Google search**: "Are guests actually using it? How does that reflect your brand?"

### "We don't have budget for this"

**Response framework**:
1. Understand: "Totally get it. Is it a timing issue or is this category not prioritized?"
2. If timing: "When does your next budget cycle start? Happy to reconnect then."
3. If priority: "What would need to be true for this to become a priority?"
4. Offer flexibility: "We have pricing models that work for different stages. Worth understanding what you need before assuming it doesn't fit?"

### "We need to think about it"

**Response framework**:
1. Clarify: "Of course. What specifically do you need to think through?"
2. Identify blocker: "Is there something I didn't address well?"
3. Offer help: "Would it help if I sent a one-pager you could share with [other stakeholder]?"
4. Set next step: "Can we schedule a follow-up for [specific date] to discuss?"

### "What makes you different from [Competitor]?"

**vs. Eventbrite/Fever**: "They're ticketing platforms - they only show their own inventory. We aggregate from everywhere, so guests see the full picture."

**vs. Building in-house**: "Totally possible. Question is whether event discovery is core to your business or a feature you need. We've spent [X] building the crawler infrastructure, data pipeline, and UX. You'd be buying years of development."

**vs. Google**: "Google shows events, but it's not brandable, not curated for your audience, and doesn't integrate with your systems. Plus your guests leave your ecosystem."

## Working with You

When asked for sales support:

1. **Understand the target**: Who are we reaching out to? What do we know about them?
2. **Research if needed**: Pull info from their website, LinkedIn, news
3. **Tailor the message**: Generic doesn't work - specificity wins
4. **Match the stage**: Cold outreach vs. follow-up vs. proposal are different
5. **Provide options**: Give 2-3 versions when possible

When creating materials:

1. **Start with the buyer**: What do they care about?
2. **Lead with their problem**: Not our solution
3. **Be specific**: Vague claims don't persuade
4. **Include next steps**: Always know what we're asking for
5. **Keep it short**: Respect their time

Remember: The goal is to start conversations and earn the right to continue them. We're not trying to close in the first touch - we're trying to earn interest.

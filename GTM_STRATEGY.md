## Executive Summary

Based on existing connections and LostCity's current product capabilities (500+ Atlanta sources, multi-portal architecture, comprehensive destination data), pursue targets in this order: **1) FORTH Hotel, 2) Gozio Health (hospital partnerships), 3) Atlanta Film Festival**.

## 2. Vertical Deep-Dives

### A. HOSPITALS (via Gozio Health Partnership)

#### The Pain Point
Hospital visitors face a triple stress: navigating an unfamiliar building, worrying about loved ones, and killing hours in waiting rooms. Current solutions (Gozio) solve *internal* navigation but leave visitors stranded once inside with no recommendations for: where to eat nearby, what to do during long waits, where out-of-town families can go in the evening.

Hospital guest services currently rely on: printed handouts (outdated), front desk recommendations (inconsistent), Yelp/Google (not curated for hospital context).

#### Product Vision: "Hospital Guest Portal"
A white-label "What to Do Near [Hospital Name]" portal embedded in the Gozio app or hospital website:

- **Proximity filtering**: "Within 10 min walk" (critical for family members who can't go far)
- **Time-aware**: "Open now" + "Open late" for shift workers/overnight visitors
- **Meal-friendly**: Family-style restaurants, delivery-friendly spots, grab-and-go cafes
- **Decompression spots**: Parks, walking trails, quiet cafes for stressed families
- **Lodging integration**: Already in Gozio's wheelhouse — LostCity enhances with neighborhood context

#### Gozio Integration Angles
1. **Feature add-on**: "Local Area Guide" module within Gozio's existing hospital apps
2. **API partnership**: Gozio licenses LostCity's data feed for their clients
3. **Co-sell arrangement**: Joint pitch to new hospital clients (Gozio handles wayfinding, LostCity handles area discovery)

#### Decision Makers
- **Gozio side**: Head of Product Partnerships, VP of Client Success
- **Hospital side**: Director of Patient Experience, Chief Experience Officer, VP of Guest Services

#### Pricing Models

| Option | Structure | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Per-Hospital License** | $1,500-5,000/mo based on bed count | 15% annual prepay discount |
| **Gozio Revenue Share** | $500-1,000/mo per hospital OR 20-30% of incremental revenue | Lower upfront, scales with adoption |
| **Hybrid** | $2,000/mo base + 5% booking commissions | Future-proofed for booking integration |

#### Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already give out printed guides" | "Those are outdated the day they print. Our data updates daily from 500+ sources." |
| "Can't visitors just use Google?" | "Google shows everything. We filter for context — walking distance, family-friendly, open during visiting hours." |
| "Budget constraints in healthcare" | "Patient experience scores impact Medicare reimbursement. This is a retention tool, not a cost center." |
| "Gozio already does this" | "Gozio does wayfinding inside the building. We handle discovery outside — complementary, not competitive." |

#### Atlanta Targets (via Gozio)
1. **Children's Healthcare of Atlanta** (3 locations, high family visitor volume)
2. **Grady Health System** (downtown, diverse population, many out-of-town families)
3. **Emory Healthcare** (Emory University Hospital, Emory Saint Joseph's)
4. **Northside Hospital** (multiple campuses)

**Pitch Angle**: "Gozio gets families to the patient room. LostCity helps them thrive during the visit."

---

### B. HOTELS (FORTH, Bellyard, Clermont)

#### The Pain Point
Boutique hotels differentiate on "local experience" but struggle to deliver personalized, up-to-date recommendations at scale. Current solutions:

- **Concierge staff**: Expensive ($50k+ salary), only available during lobby hours, inconsistent knowledge
- **Generic software** (Actabl, Canary, Intelity): Focus on room service, amenity booking, not authentic local discovery
- **Printed guides/QR codes**: Static, not personalized, require constant updating

#### Product Vision: "Hotel Local Guide Portal"

A branded `{hotelname}.lostcity.com` or embedded in hotel app/website:

1. **Walking radius filtering**: "5 min walk," "10 min walk" from hotel
2. **Vibe matching**: Hotel's brand mapped to recommended venues
3. **Tonight/This Weekend**: Dynamic event feed based on guest arrival dates
4. **Concierge overrides**: Hotel can pin specific partner venues to the top
5. **White-label branding**: Hotel's logo, colors, fonts — looks native to their brand

#### Hotel-Specific Customization

**FORTH Hotel** (wellness, design, community):
- Wellness: Yoga studios, BeltLine trails, Historic Fourth Ward Park, health-focused restaurants
- Design: Galleries, architecture walks, design district shops
- Community: Old Fourth Ward events, BeltLine markets, neighborhood festivals
- Their own venues (Il Premio, Moonlight rooftop, Elektra poolside) appear first

**Bellyard** (boutique, local authenticity):
- Filter for neighborhood spots in Midtown, hide chain restaurants
- Emphasize local authenticity over tourist traps

**Clermont** (iconic, edgy):
- Dive bars, live music, LGBTQ+ venues, late-night spots
- Lean into the Clermont Lounge's legendary status

#### Pricing

| Tier | Monthly | Features |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Starter** | $1,200/mo | Basic portal, 1 city, standard branding |
| **Pro** | $2,500/mo | Custom branding, concierge admin panel, analytics, partner pinning |
| **Enterprise** | $5,000/mo | Multi-property, API access, white-glove onboarding |

#### Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We have a concierge for this" | "This scales your concierge. Guests use it at 2am, before arrival, after checkout." |
| "Too expensive" | "One concierge = $50k/year. This is $12-30k/year for 24/7 coverage with better data." |
| "Our guests just use Google" | "Google shows ads and chains. This is curated, brand-aligned, and drives guests to partners you trust." |
| "Our PMS vendor already has this" | "Show me their Atlanta coverage. Most generic platforms have 50-100 venues. We have 2,300+." |

#### Atlanta Context
- **FORTH is brand-new** (opened July 2024) — still assembling tech stack, no incumbent vendor
- On the BeltLine — LostCity's coverage is strongest in walkable urban areas
- Competitive pressure from Four Seasons, St. Regis, Waldorf Astoria — FORTH needs a tech-enabled edge

---

### C. ATLANTA FILM (ATLFF + Plaza Theatre)

#### The Pain Point
1. **Discovery beyond attendees**: ATLFF has ~30,000 attendees during the festival, but no year-round engagement tool
2. **Audience development**: Plaza shows films year-round, but marketing reach is limited
3. **Sponsorship value**: Hard to offer sponsors meaningful activation beyond logo placement

#### Product Vision: "Atlanta Film Portal"

**Festival-Time Features:**
- ATLFF schedule with filtering (genre, venue, date/time)
- "Build Your Schedule" tool (personalized festival itinerary)
- Discovery: "If you liked [Film X], try these other screenings"
- Venue navigation: Which films are at Plaza vs. Tara vs. Rialto

**Year-Round Features:**
- All Atlanta indie cinema showtimes (Plaza, Tara, Lefont, Landmark Midtown Art Cinema)
- Film series tracking (repertory screenings, retrospectives)
- Film + dinner pairing suggestions (restaurants near theaters)
- Filmmaker events (Q&As, premieres, special screenings)

#### Pricing

| Option | Structure | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Nonprofit-Friendly** | $1,000/mo year-round | Simple, predictable |
| **Festival + Annual** | $5,000 festival + $6,000/yr | Bundled: $10,000/yr |
| **Revenue Share** | Free portal, 20-30% of sponsorships sold against it | Zero upfront cost |
| **Freemium / Case Study** | Free for ATLFF, use as case study for national festivals | Revenue from future clients |

#### Strategic Value Beyond Revenue
1. **Brand halo**: Oscar-qualifying festival = instant credibility
2. **Press opportunity**: "LostCity Powers Atlanta Film Festival" = media coverage during high-visibility time
3. **Network effect**: ATLFF connects to filmmakers, venues, sponsors — potential future customers
4. **Product proof**: Demonstrates complex, multi-venue, time-sensitive event schedules (valuable for conferences)

### D. TOURISM BOARDS (Discover Atlanta)

#### The Pain Point
- Websites are static, content updated quarterly not daily
- Generic "Things to Do" lists, not personalized or time-bound
- Visitors want "What's happening this weekend?" — tourism boards deliver "Top 20 Attractions" that never changes

#### Product Vision
Power the "Events" section of DiscoverAtlanta.com with LostCity's live feed — real-time, filterable by date/category/neighborhood/price.

#### Pricing: $5,000-15,000/month (annual contract)

#### Sales Cycle Reality
6-12 months from first meeting to signed contract. This is a 2026-2027 revenue play. Plant seeds now.

---

### E. LOCAL PUBLICATIONS (Creative Loafing, Atlanta Magazine)

#### The Pain Point
Local media is dying. Ad revenue is down, maintaining an events calendar is expensive editorial labor with little ROI.

#### Product Vision
Replace manually-updated events sections with a LostCity-powered widget matching their branding. Publications can sell "Featured Event" ad placements, or LostCity sells and splits revenue 50/50.

#### Pricing: $500-1,500/month or free + revenue share

#### Strategic Value
Distribution + credibility + SEO backlinks. Even at low revenue, publications provide brand awareness and proof points for other media outlets.

---

### F. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

#### The Pain Point
Cities want to promote local events and economic activity but lack infrastructure for comprehensive calendars.

#### Product Vision
City-branded events portal (e.g., `events.atlantaga.gov`) with equity lens ensuring all neighborhoods have coverage.

#### Pricing: $50,000/year annual contract or grant-funded pilot at $10,000/6mo

#### Sales Cycle Reality
12-24 months. RFPs, budget approvals, political dynamics. Long-term play only.

3. Offer free 30-day trial of custom-branded portal
4. Close at $2,000/month annual contract ($24k/year)

### Target #2: Gozio Health

---

## 7. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Sales take longer than expected | Focus on FORTH first (shortest cycle), don't wait for slow-movers |
| Product isn't ready for white-label | Build FORTH mockup as proof-of-concept, iterate before scaling |
| Customers want features you don't have | Offer roadmap commitment: "We'll build X if you sign now" (only if 2+ request it) |
| Competition from incumbents | Position as complementary, not competitive |
| Revenue too small to justify effort | Focus on strategic value (logos, case studies, vertical validation) not just dollars |
| Founder bandwidth limited | Prioritize: FORTH (60%), Gozio (30%), ATLFF (10%). Defer others to Phase 2 |

---

## 8. Key Metrics to Track

**Sales**: Meetings booked/week (target: 3-5), demos delivered (2-3/week), proposals sent (1-2/week), contracts signed (1 in first 60 days)

**Product**: Portal engagement rate, time spent (target: 3+ min), click-through to venues (target: 20%+), repeat usage

**Customer Success**: NPS score, churn rate (target: <5% annually), expansion revenue

**Strategic**: Reference customers willing to do case studies (target: 100% of first 5), inbound from referrals (1/quarter by Q3), press mentions (3-5 from ATLFF partnership)

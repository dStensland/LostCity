## 1. Universal Value Proposition

### The Core Pitch

**LostCity turns Atlanta into a searchable, explorable database.**

We've built the most comprehensive event and destination dataset for Atlanta — 11,000+ events from 500+ sources, 2,300+ venues with full metadata, updated daily. We make this available to organizations through white-label portals that feel native to your brand.

**What we solve:** Every organization serving Atlanta audiences faces the same problem — people want local recommendations, but curating events and destinations is a full-time job. Manual curation doesn't scale, goes stale, and never covers the breadth of what's actually happening in the city.

**What we offer:** A branded discovery experience powered by comprehensive, always-current data. Your guests/employees/members get tailored recommendations without your team doing the research.

**The business model:** We charge a monthly fee for portal access. You get unlimited users, full customization, and continuous data updates. We handle the infrastructure, crawling, data quality, and enrichment — you get the value of a full event curation team without the headcount.

### Why This Works

1. **Comprehensiveness** — We crawl 500+ sources, from major venues to neighborhood bars, dive venues to arenas. We capture what other platforms miss.

2. **Always Current** — Daily automated crawls mean recommendations never go stale. You're not relying on editorial staff to update a spreadsheet.

3. **Zero Operational Overhead** — No one on your team spends time researching events, updating content, or maintaining a calendar.

4. **Brand Alignment** — White-label means it's your experience, not ours. Your logo, your domain, your brand voice.

5. **Destination-First** — We capture places people want to visit (bars, restaurants, galleries, parks), not just ticketed events. This makes us valuable for "what should I do tonight?" discovery, not just "buy tickets."

## 2. Vertical-Specific One-Pagers

### A. Hospitals (via Gozio)

**Target:** Hospital systems using Gozio for wayfinding/visitor apps

**Headline:** Give families and visitors something to do while they wait — without adding to your team's workload.

**The Pain:**
- Family members traveling to Atlanta for patient care are stuck waiting in unfamiliar neighborhoods
- Concierge teams get asked "what's nearby?" but don't have time to research current events
- Visitors searching on their own end up on generic Google results, not curated local recommendations
- No way to showcase the neighborhood around your campus as a positive amenity

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Reduce stress for out-of-town families** — Give them productive ways to spend time nearby (coffee shops, parks, restaurants, events)
2. **Zero staff time** — No one from your team maintains the content; it updates automatically
3. **Neighborhood showcase** — Position your location as convenient to Atlanta's culture and amenities
4. **Gozio integration-ready** — Can be embedded in existing app or linked from wayfinding portal

**How It Works:**
- We provide a white-label portal (e.g., atlanta.emoryhealthcare.org) or embeddable widget
- Automatically filters to events/destinations within X miles of your campus
- Optionally highlights family-friendly, free, and evening options
- Updates daily with new events and venue information

**Social Proof:**
- "We're working with 2,300+ Atlanta destinations and 500+ event sources — from the Alliance Theatre to neighborhood coffee shops"
- "11,000+ events in our database right now, all verified and enriched with times, descriptions, images"

**Call to Action:**
"Let's do a 15-minute walkthrough of what this could look like for [Hospital Name] families."

---

### B. Hotels (Boutique/Aspiring Premium)

**Target:** The Forth Hotel, The Bellyard, The Clermont

**Headline:** Your concierge, automated. Give guests insider recommendations without the research overhead.

**The Pain:**
- Guests expect local expertise, but concierge teams are juggling 10+ tasks
- Recommendations go stale — the weekly jazz night you recommended closed 6 months ago
- Generic platforms (Google, Yelp) don't reflect your brand's POV or curation
- Competitors with larger teams can offer more comprehensive local guides
- You want to position as "locally connected" but don't have bandwidth to prove it

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Brand differentiation** — A custom Atlanta guide positions you as the insider, not just a bed
2. **Guest experience upgrade** — Tailored recommendations by vibe, neighborhood, time of day
3. **Concierge efficiency** — Staff can reference the portal instead of Googling every request
4. **Always current** — Events update daily, no manual maintenance

**How It Works:**
- Branded portal (discover.theforthhotel.com) or in-room tablet integration
- Curate by vibe tags (romantic, lively, upscale, dive-y, LGBTQ-friendly, etc.)
- Neighborhood filtering (Midtown, Poncey-Highland, East Atlanta Village)
- Option to feature partner venues or sponsored placements

**Example Use Cases:**
- Guest asks: "Where should we go for live music tonight in Midtown?"
  - Concierge pulls up portal, filters to music + Midtown + tonight → 12 options with times, prices, descriptions
- In-room tablet shows: "Happening tonight near The Forth" widget on welcome screen
- Email confirmation includes: "Explore Atlanta during your stay" link to custom guide

**Social Proof:**
- "2,300+ Atlanta destinations mapped, from rooftop bars to dive venues to coffee shops"
- "We capture events other platforms miss — neighborhood trivia nights, gallery openings, weekly residencies"
- Data completeness: 88% of events have full details (time, price, description, image)

**Call to Action:**
"I'd love to show you a mockup of what this could look like for The Forth — 15 minutes next week?"

---

### C. Atlanta Film (ATLFF + Plaza Theatre)

**Target:** Atlanta Film Festival (ATLFF) and Plaza Theatre — founder has event planning connections

**Headline:** Turn your audience into year-round film discoverers, not just festival attendees.

**The Pain:**
- ATLFF is annual — how do you keep your audience engaged the other 51 weeks?
- Plaza Theatre has great programming, but discoverability is limited to people who already follow you
- Atlanta has a thriving film scene (indie cinemas, repertory screenings, film clubs), but it's scattered
- No central place to send people who ask "what else is showing in Atlanta indie film?"
- Limited tools to cross-promote between ATLFF, Plaza, and the broader film community

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Year-round engagement** — A branded film discovery portal keeps your audience coming back between festivals
2. **Community building** — Position ATLFF as the hub of Atlanta film culture, not just an annual event
3. **Cross-promotion** — Promote Plaza screenings, other indie theaters, and upcoming ATLFF events in one place
4. **Audience development** — Introduce festival-goers to ongoing film programming citywide

**How It Works:**
- Branded portal (film.atlff.org or discover.plazaatlanta.com)
- Filter to film category, independent/art house venues, special screenings
- Highlight ATLFF-affiliated venues or partners
- Series tracking (e.g., "Wes Anderson Retrospective at Plaza Theatre" groups all showtimes)
- Option to feature festival alumni films or filmmaker-in-residence events

**Example Use Cases:**
- Festival attendee asks: "I loved this documentary — where can I see more like it in Atlanta?"
  - Portal shows: 8 upcoming documentary screenings across Plaza, Tara Theatre, Atlanta Jewish Film Festival
- Year-round audience nurturing: Monthly email with "This month in Atlanta indie film" powered by portal data
- Plaza Theatre homepage widget: "Also playing in Atlanta this week" — builds goodwill, positions as community hub

**Social Proof:**
- "We track 500+ film events/month across Atlanta — repertory screenings, festivals, special events"
- "Full series support — Miyazaki retrospectives, Criterion collections, director spotlights grouped together"
- "Integration with OMDB for posters, plot summaries, director info — rich metadata on every screening"

**Call to Action:**
"Let's talk about how we could use this to extend ATLFF's reach beyond the festival and support Plaza's programming year-round."

---

### D. Tourism Boards

**Target:** Discover Atlanta, CVB, metro tourism organizations

**Headline:** Comprehensive event data for visitors, without the editorial overhead.

**The Pain:**
- Tourism websites need fresh event content, but editorial teams can't cover 11,000+ events
- Visitor questions go beyond "top 10 attractions" — they want "what's happening this weekend in Midtown?"
- Generic event feeds (Eventbrite embeds) only show ticketed events, missing free/neighborhood stuff
- Manual curation favors sponsors and partners, but visitors want authentic local experiences
- Content goes stale quickly — someone updates the site monthly, events change daily

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Editorial efficiency** — Stop manually updating event calendars; we handle it automatically
2. **Comprehensive coverage** — From arena shows to dive bar trivia, we capture the breadth of Atlanta
3. **Visitor-centric filtering** — Neighborhoods, vibes, price points, dates — help visitors find their fit
4. **Data quality** — 88% of events have full details (times, prices, descriptions, images)

**How It Works:**
- White-label portal (events.discoveratlanta.com) or embeddable widgets for existing site
- Filter by neighborhood, category, date range, price (free vs. paid)
- Vibe tags: family-friendly, romantic, LGBTQ-friendly, outdoor, upscale, dive-y
- API access for custom integrations

**Example Use Cases:**
- Visitor asks: "What's happening this weekend that's family-friendly and free?"
  - Portal filters to: family-friendly + free + Sat-Sun → festivals, park events, library programs
- Tourism site homepage: "This Week in Atlanta" auto-updating widget powered by our data
- Chatbot integration: Visitor asks questions, bot queries our API for real-time event results

**Social Proof:**
- "11,000+ upcoming events from 500+ sources — we crawl everything from the Fox Theatre to neighborhood bars"
- "2,300+ destinations mapped with coordinates, neighborhoods, and vibe tags"
- "Daily automated updates — fresher than any manually curated calendar"

**Call to Action:**
"Can we show you how much more comprehensive this is than what's currently on DiscoverAtlanta.com? 20-minute demo?"

---

### E. Publications (Local Media)

**Target:** Atlanta Magazine, Creative Loafing, Rough Draft, local blogs

**Headline:** Fresh event content for your site, zero writer hours, optional affiliate revenue.

**The Pain:**
- Event roundups require writer time every week ("10 Things to Do This Weekend")
- Editorial coverage is limited — you can't cover 11,000+ events with a small team
- Readers want comprehensive "what's happening" not just editorial picks
- Event listings don't drive revenue — they're a service, not a product
- Manual event submissions from venues are inconsistent and low-quality

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Automated content feed** — Embed our event database; it updates daily without writer input
2. **Audience engagement** — Readers come back weekly to browse events, not just read one article
3. **Editorial + Data** — Keep doing curated picks, supplement with comprehensive browsable calendar
4. **Revenue potential** — Affiliate ticket links (we can share revenue on ticket sales driven from your site)

**How It Works:**
- Embeddable event widget for your site, or custom-branded portal (events.atlantamagazine.com)
- You control filtering defaults (e.g., "upscale" for Atlanta Magazine, "dive-y" for Creative Loafing)
- Optional editorial tagging: "Staff Pick" or "Recommended" flags on specific events
- API access to pull event data into your CMS for article writing

**Example Use Cases:**
- Creative Loafing homepage: "All Events in Atlanta This Week" filterable widget
- Atlanta Magazine: "Recommended Events" section with staff-curated picks from our database
- Rough Draft: "Atlanta Music Calendar" widget filtering to live music + upcoming 30 days
- Weekly email newsletter: Auto-generated "This Weekend in Atlanta" from portal data

**Social Proof:**
- "11,000+ events, 500+ sources — we crawl venues your writers don't have time to cover"
- "88% of events have full metadata — times, prices, descriptions, images — ready to publish"
- "We capture recurring events (weekly trivia, residencies) that most calendars miss"

**Call to Action:**
"I'd love to show you a mockup of what an Atlanta Magazine-branded event portal could look like. 15 minutes?"

---

### F. Local Government (City/County)

**Target:** City of Atlanta, Fulton/DeKalb County, metro municipalities

**Headline:** Help residents discover what's happening in their city — without building it yourself.

**The Pain:**
- Residents complain "there's nothing to do" when there are actually 11,000+ events
- City websites have outdated event calendars or nothing at all
- Community engagement initiatives need to drive foot traffic to local businesses and events
- No centralized resource for "what's happening in [neighborhood]?"
- Building and maintaining an event platform is expensive and out of scope for city IT

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Resident engagement** — Give people a reason to explore their city beyond Google searches
2. **Economic development** — Drive foot traffic to local businesses, venues, and cultural institutions
3. **Equity** — Surface free and low-cost events, not just high-priced ticketed shows
4. **Turnkey solution** — We handle infrastructure, data collection, and maintenance

**How It Works:**
- White-label portal (discover.atlantaga.gov or events.fultoncoung.org)
- Filter by neighborhood, city council district, or zip code
- Highlight free events, parks/recreation programming, and community gatherings
- API access for integration with existing city websites or apps

**Example Use Cases:**
- Resident asks: "What's happening in my neighborhood this weekend?"
  - Portal filters to: Inman Park + Sat-Sun → 15 events (farmers market, gallery opening, live music)
- City council wants to promote district events — custom view for each district
- Parks & Rec department: Showcase programming alongside private events at city parks
- Economic development office: Share with new residents as "Welcome to Atlanta" resource

**Social Proof:**
- "2,300+ destinations across metro Atlanta — ITP, OTP, Decatur, and beyond"
- "Coverage includes free events, community gatherings, and neighborhood spots (not just ticketed shows)"
- "Daily updates — more current than any manually maintained city calendar"

**Call to Action:**
"Let's talk about how this could support [City/County]'s resident engagement and economic development goals. 20-minute call?"

## 3. Demo Script Outline (15 Minutes)

### Opening (2 minutes) — Establish Pain Point
**Script:**
"Before I show you the platform, tell me — how do you currently handle local event recommendations for [guests/employees/members]?"

**Listen for:**
- "We have a concierge team that Googles it"
- "We have a static list on our website"
- "We don't really — people figure it out themselves"
- "We built something in-house but it's hard to keep updated"

**Agitate:**
"And how often does that get updated? What happens when events are stale or the person who maintains it is on vacation?"

**Transition:**
"That's exactly the problem we solve. Let me show you what 11,000 events and 2,300 destinations looks like when it's actually organized."

### Product Walkthrough (7 minutes) — Show, Don't Tell

**1. Homepage / Overview (1 min)**
- "This is what the portal looks like — clean, simple, focused on discovery."
- Show: Featured events, category tiles, search bar
- Emphasize: "This is what YOUR guests/members would see — your branding, your logo."

**2. Search & Filtering (3 min)**
- "Let's say someone asks: 'What's happening this weekend in Midtown that's good for a date?'"
- Live filter: Date range (Fri-Sat), Neighborhood (Midtown), Vibe tag (romantic)
- Results: "Here are 8 options — notice each has time, price, description, image."
- Click into one event: "Full detail page — address, map, ticket link, venue info."

**3. Destination Discovery (2 min)**
- "We're not just events — we're destinations. Let's browse bars in East Atlanta Village."
- Show venue list view: Images, neighborhoods, tags
- Click into a venue: "Hours, address, upcoming events at this spot, vibe tags."
- Emphasize: "This is valuable even if someone isn't looking for a specific event — it's 'where should I go tonight?'"

**4. Category Deep-Dive (1 min)**
- Pick a category relevant to them (e.g., music for hotel, film for ATLFF)
- Show breadth: "Here are 200+ upcoming music events — from arenas to dive bars."
- Show series grouping (if relevant): "We group recurring events — like weekly jazz nights or film retrospectives."

### Customization Possibilities (3 minutes)

**"Here's what we can tailor for you:"**

1. **Branding** — Your logo, colors, domain (yoursite.com or subdomain)
2. **Filtering defaults** — Highlight specific neighborhoods, vibes, or categories
3. **Featured placements** — Pin specific venues or events at the top
4. **Embed options** — Widget on your existing site, or standalone portal
5. **API access** — Pull event data into your app/CMS if you want to build custom features

**Show example:**
- "For a boutique hotel, we might default to 'upscale' + 'romantic' + 'within 2 miles of your property.'"
- "For a film festival, we'd filter to 'film' category and highlight your partner venues."
- "For a hospital, we'd show 'family-friendly' + 'free/low-cost' + 'within 5 miles of campus.'"

### Data/Coverage Highlights (2 minutes)

**"Why this works better than alternatives:"**

1. **Comprehensiveness** — "We crawl 500+ sources. That includes Ticketmaster, but also the neighborhood bar's website that only has 8 events/year."
2. **Always current** — "Daily automated crawls. If a venue adds an event this morning, it's in the system tonight."
3. **Destination-first** — "We capture bars, restaurants, coffee shops, galleries — not just ticketed events. That's 2,300+ places people want to visit."
4. **Data quality** — "88% of events have full metadata — time, price, description, image. We use AI to fill gaps when venues don't provide details."
5. **Neighborhood granularity** — "We don't just say 'Atlanta' — we have 50+ neighborhoods mapped. People can filter to their area."

**Proof points:**
- "11,000+ upcoming events right now"
- "2,300+ venues mapped with coordinates and images"
- "500+ data sources crawled automatically"
- "90% venue data completeness (address, neighborhood, images)"

### Close / Next Steps (1 minute)

**"Here's what I'm thinking:"**

1. **Pilot timeline** — "We could have a branded portal live for you in 2-4 weeks."
2. **What we need from you:**
   - Logo and brand colors
   - Any filtering preferences (neighborhoods, vibes, categories to highlight)
   - Domain/subdomain decision (embed vs. standalone)

3. **Pricing** (if appropriate to discuss) — "We charge a monthly fee for unlimited users and continuous updates. Let me send over a proposal with specific tiers."

**Ask:**
"What questions do you have? And who else on your team should see this before we move forward?"

---

## 4. Objection Handling Guide

### Objection 1: "We already have something for this" / "People just use Google"

**Response:**
"That's great — what are you using currently?"

**Listen, then differentiate:**

- **If they say "Google/Yelp":**
  - "Right — but those are generic to everyone. What we offer is brandable to YOUR audience and filterable to what matters to them. Plus, Google shows everything — including stuff 30 miles away. We let you set boundaries that make sense."

- **If they say "Eventbrite embed" or similar:**
  - "Totally. Question — does that show events from venues that don't use Eventbrite? Like the neighborhood bar with weekly trivia, or the gallery opening that's just on their website? We aggregate from 500+ sources, not just ticketing platforms."

- **If they say "We built something in-house":**
  - "That's impressive. How much time does your team spend keeping it current? Who handles it when they're on vacation?"
  - Agitate: "We've found that in-house solutions work great initially, but the ongoing maintenance becomes a hidden cost — someone's job becomes 'event curator' whether that was the plan or not."

**Close:**
"I'm not saying replace what you're doing overnight. But let me show you a side-by-side of what you have vs. what 500+ automated sources looks like. 15 minutes?"

---

### Objection 2: "We don't have budget for this"

**Response:**
"Totally understand. Is it a timing issue (like budget's locked until next quarter), or is this category just not prioritized right now?"

**If timing:**
- "Got it. When does your next budget cycle start?"
- "Would it help if I sent a proposal now so you have numbers for planning?"
- Set a follow-up: "Let's reconnect in [month] when you're reviewing budgets."

**If priority:**
- "What would need to be true for this to become a priority?"
- Listen for: guest complaints, competitor doing it, leadership mandate, new initiative
- Reframe: "What's the cost of NOT solving this? If 5% of your guests are asking 'what should we do in Atlanta?' and getting stale recommendations, what's that worth in guest satisfaction?"

**Offer flexibility:**
- "We have different tiers depending on what features you need. Maybe we start with something simpler and expand later?"
- "Would a pilot make sense — try it for 3 months, see if your team and [guests/members] actually use it?"

---

### Objection 3: "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Of course. What specifically do you need to think through?"

**Likely answers and how to handle:**

- **"I need to talk to my team/boss":**
  - "Makes sense. Is there something I didn't address well that you're concerned about?"
  - "Would it help if I put together a one-pager you can share with [stakeholder]? What are the top 3 things they'd want to know?"

- **"I'm not sure about the ROI":**
  - "Fair question. How do you currently measure success with local recommendations?"
  - Reframe: "Think of it this way — if your team spends 5 hours/week Googling events for guests, that's $X,000/year in labor. We're a fraction of that, and we're comprehensive."

- **"We're in the middle of other projects":**
  - "I get it. When would be a better time to revisit?"
  - Offer: "We can have this ready to go when you're ready — setup takes 2-4 weeks, so if you want to launch in Q2, we should start the conversation in March."

**Always set a next step:**
"Can we schedule a follow-up for [specific date] to discuss what you've thought through?"

---

### Objection 4: "How is this different from [Competitor]?"

**vs. Eventbrite / Ticketing Platforms:**
- "They're ticketing platforms — they only show events that use their ticketing system. We aggregate from 500+ sources, including venues that have their own ticketing, free events, and places that don't sell tickets at all."
- "We capture destinations (bars, restaurants, galleries), not just ticketed events. That's a different use case."

**vs. Google Events / Google Maps:**
- "Google shows events, but it's not brandable to your organization, not curated for your audience, and it includes everything within a huge radius. We let you set neighborhood filters, vibe tags, and customize what shows up."
- "Google doesn't group recurring events (like weekly jazz nights). We do."

**vs. Building In-House:**
- "Totally possible to build. The question is whether event discovery is core to your business or a feature you need."
- "We've spent 2 years building the crawler infrastructure to pull from 500+ sources, the data enrichment pipeline to fill missing details, and the deduplication logic to avoid showing the same event 5 times. You'd be buying those 2 years of development time."
- "Plus, crawlers break when venues redesign their websites — someone has to maintain them. That's our full-time job."

**vs. Other Event Aggregators:**
- "What makes us different is we capture destinations, not just events. Bars, coffee shops, galleries — places people want to go even if they're not looking for a specific event."
- "We're also hyper-local — 50+ neighborhoods mapped in Atlanta, not just 'metro Atlanta.'"

---

### Objection 5: "Our audience won't use it"

**Response:**
"What makes you think that? Have people asked for local recommendations before?"

**Listen, then counter:**

- **If they say "yes, but...":**
  - "So there IS demand — the question is just how to surface it, right?"
  - "What if we made this stupidly easy to access — like a QR code on the welcome desk or a link in your email signature?"

- **If they say "people just Google it":**
  - "Sure — but Google shows results 30 miles away and doesn't filter to vibes or neighborhoods. We can make it more relevant."
  - "Think of this as a value-add, not a replacement. Some people will Google, some people will ask your staff, some people will browse your portal. You're covering all bases."

**Offer a pilot:**
"What if we tried it for 3 months and tracked usage? We can add Google Analytics to the portal and see if people actually engage. If they don't, we re-evaluate."

---

### Objection 6: "This seems complicated to set up"

**Response:**
"Actually, setup is really light on your end. Here's what we need from you:"

**List the minimal requirements:**
1. Logo file (PNG or SVG)
2. Brand colors (hex codes)
3. Domain or subdomain decision (do you want events.yoursite.com or an embed on your existing site?)
4. Any filtering preferences (neighborhoods, categories to highlight)

**Timeline:**
- "We can have the portal live in 2-4 weeks."
- "After that, it's zero maintenance on your end — we handle updates, crawling, and data quality."

**Close:**
"Does that sound manageable? Or is there something else you're worried about on the setup side?"

---

### Objection 7: "We need to see more proof this works"

**Response:**
"Totally fair. What would count as proof for you?"

**Likely answers and how to respond:**

- **"Do you have case studies?":**
  - "We're early, so we don't have published case studies yet. But I can walk you through our data quality metrics — 11,000+ events, 88% completeness, 500+ sources."
  - "Or we can do a pilot — you try it for 3 months, we track usage, and you decide if it's worth continuing."

- **"Can I talk to a current customer?":**
  - "Let me check if any of our partners are willing to do a reference call. Who would be most relevant for you to talk to — another hotel, a tourism board, etc.?"

- **"Can we see usage stats?":**
  - "We can add analytics to your portal so you see exactly how many people are using it, what they're searching for, and what events get the most clicks."

**Close:**
"What metric would make you confident this is working? Unique users? Click-through rate on events? Let's define success together and track it."

## 5. Email Templates

### A. Gozio/Hospital Connection (Warm Intro)

**Subject:** Local discovery for [Hospital] patients & families

Hi [Name],

[Mutual contact] mentioned you handle digital experience at [Hospital] and might be interested in how we're helping hospital visitors explore Atlanta.

Quick context: We've built a comprehensive database of Atlanta events and destinations (11,000+ events from 500+ sources, 2,300+ venues). We offer this as a white-label portal that organizations can brand for their audiences.

**For hospitals, the use case is simple:** Out-of-town families waiting for patient care often ask "what's nearby?" or "what can I do this evening?" Right now, that either falls on concierge staff to research, or families Google it themselves and get overwhelmed.

We can provide a branded portal (or embeddable widget in your Gozio app) that filters to:
- Events/destinations near your campus
- Family-friendly, free, or evening options
- Restaurants, coffee shops, parks, and cultural activities

Zero maintenance on your end — we update the data daily.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this fits what [Hospital] is trying to do for visitors?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### B. Hotel GM (Warm/Cold Outreach)

**Subject:** Idea for [Hotel Name]'s guest experience

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Hotel Name]'s positioning as [insert their brand POV — e.g., "the insider's hotel in Atlanta" or "boutique luxury in Midtown"], and I think we might have a fit.

Quick context: We've built the most comprehensive event and destination database for Atlanta — 11,000+ upcoming events from 500+ sources, 2,300+ venues (everything from rooftop bars to dive venues to coffee shops).

We offer this as a white-label portal for hotels, so your guests get curated local recommendations that feel like they're coming from you, not Google.

**Why this might matter for [Hotel]:**
- Your guests expect local expertise, but keeping recommendations current is a full-time job
- A branded Atlanta guide positions you as the insider connection (not just a bed)
- Concierge teams can reference it instead of Googling every request
- Zero maintenance — we update the data daily

I'd love to show you a quick mockup of what this could look like for [Hotel] — 15 minutes next week?

Let me know if you're open to it.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### C. ATLFF / Plaza Theatre (Leveraging Existing Relationship)

**Subject:** Year-round engagement idea for ATLFF / Plaza

Hi [Name],

I've been thinking about how ATLFF and Plaza could stay top-of-mind for Atlanta film lovers year-round, not just during the festival.

We've built a comprehensive database of Atlanta events — and one of the categories we track closely is **film**. That's 500+ screenings/month across indie theaters, repertory cinemas, film clubs, and special events.

**The idea:** A white-label film discovery portal that you brand as ATLFF or Plaza — so your audience can explore what's showing across Atlanta's indie film scene.

**Why this works:**
- Keeps your audience engaged between festivals
- Positions ATLFF as the hub of Atlanta film culture (not just an annual event)
- Cross-promotes Plaza screenings alongside other indie venues
- Zero editorial overhead — we crawl venues and update daily

We already track Plaza's showtimes, series (like Miyazaki retrospectives), and special screenings. We just need to surface it in a way that feels like your brand.

Can we grab 20 minutes to walk through what this could look like?

Let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### D. Tourism Board (Cold Outreach)

**Subject:** More comprehensive event data for Discover Atlanta

Hi [Name],

I noticed Discover Atlanta's event calendar and wanted to reach out with a thought.

We've built a database of 11,000+ upcoming Atlanta events from 500+ sources — everything from Fox Theatre shows to neighborhood trivia nights. We offer this as white-label portals or embeddable widgets for tourism sites.

**Why I think this might be relevant:**
- Your team probably can't manually cover 11,000+ events — editorial doesn't scale
- Visitors want granular filtering ("what's happening this weekend in Midtown?"), not just top 10 lists
- Generic event feeds (like Eventbrite embeds) miss free events and neighborhood stuff
- Content goes stale fast unless someone's updating it daily (we handle that automatically)

We've mapped 2,300+ Atlanta destinations (bars, restaurants, galleries, parks) with neighborhoods, vibe tags, and coordinates. It's built for "what should I do tonight?" discovery, not just ticketed events.

Would you be open to a 20-minute demo to see if this is more comprehensive than what's currently on DiscoverAtlanta.com?

Happy to work around your schedule.

### E. Local Government (Warm Outreach)

**Subject:** Resident engagement resource for [City/County]

Hi [Name],

[Mutual contact] mentioned you're working on resident engagement initiatives for [City/County] and suggested I reach out.

We've built a comprehensive database of Atlanta metro events and destinations — 11,000+ events from 500+ sources, 2,300+ venues mapped by neighborhood.

**For cities/counties, the use case is:**
- Residents complain "there's nothing to do" when there are actually thousands of events
- City websites have outdated calendars or nothing at all
- No centralized "what's happening in [neighborhood]?" resource
- Building and maintaining an event platform in-house is expensive and out of scope

We offer a white-label portal (e.g., discover.atlantaga.gov) that filters by neighborhood, highlights free events, and updates daily — zero maintenance on your end.

This could support economic development (driving foot traffic to local businesses), equity (surfacing free/low-cost events), and community engagement goals.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to see if this aligns with what [City/County] is trying to do?

Best,
[Your Name]

## 6. Follow-Up Sequences

### Cold Email Follow-Up Sequence

**Follow-Up 1 (3 days after initial email):**

Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note below about a branded Atlanta discovery portal for [Organization].

I know inboxes are busy — if this isn't relevant, feel free to let me know and I'll stop bothering you.

But if you're curious what 11,000+ events organized by neighborhood, category, and vibe looks like, I'd love to show you a quick demo.

15 minutes next week?

Best,
[Your Name]

**Follow-Up 2 (7 days after Follow-Up 1) — Different Angle:**

Subject: [Specific observation about their audience]

Hi [Name],

I was looking at [specific thing about their site/org] and had a thought.

[Your audience type] are probably asking you "what should I do in Atlanta?" all the time. Right now, you're either:
- Sending them to Google (generic, overwhelming)
- Manually curating recommendations (time-consuming, goes stale)
- Not addressing it (missed opportunity)

We've built a third option: a branded portal with 11,000+ Atlanta events and 2,300+ destinations that updates daily.

Still interested in seeing how this works? I'll keep it to 15 minutes.

Best,
[Your Name]

**Follow-Up 3 (14 days after Follow-Up 2) — Break-Up Email:**

Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a couple times about a branded Atlanta event portal for [Organization]. I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing:
- Timing isn't right
- Not a priority
- You're already solving this another way

No worries either way — I just wanted to close the loop.

If you want to revisit down the road, you know where to find me.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Demo Follow-Up Sequence

**Immediately After Demo:**

Subject: Thanks for the time — next steps

Hi [Name],

Thanks for walking through the portal with me today. A few things I heard that seem like priorities for you:
- [Specific pain point they mentioned]
- [Specific feature they liked]
- [Specific concern they raised]

**Next steps I'm proposing:**
1. I'll send over a proposal with pricing tiers by [date]
2. You'll review with [stakeholder they mentioned]
3. We'll reconnect on [specific date] to discuss questions

Does that sound right? Or is there something else you need from me?

Best,
[Your Name]

**Follow-Up 1 (If no response 5 days after demo):**

Subject: Re: Thanks for the time — next steps

Hi [Name],

Just circling back on the proposal I sent over on [date].

I know you mentioned needing to chat with [stakeholder] — have you had a chance to do that?

Happy to answer any questions that came up, or jump on a follow-up call if that helps.

Let me know where things stand.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

**Follow-Up 2 (If no response 10 days after demo):**

Subject: Still interested?

Hi [Name],

Haven't heard from you since our demo a couple weeks ago. Are you still interested in moving forward, or has this been de-prioritized?

If it's timing, I'm happy to reconnect when it makes more sense. If it's not a fit, totally understand — just let me know so I'm not pestering you.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 7. Pricing Discussion Framework

### When to Talk Pricing

**Don't lead with pricing.** Lead with value, pain, and product. Pricing comes up when:
- They ask explicitly
- You're closing the demo and setting next steps
- You're sending a follow-up proposal

### Pricing Tiers (Example — Adjust as Needed)

**Tier 1: Basic Portal ($500/month)**
- White-label portal on our domain (yourorg.lostcity.com)
- Unlimited users
- Filtering by category, neighborhood, date, vibe
- Monthly data updates
- Basic customization (logo, colors)

**Tier 2: Pro Portal ($1,200/month)**
- Custom domain (events.yoursite.com)
- Embeddable widgets for your existing site
- Weekly data updates
- Advanced customization (featured placements, default filters)
- Analytics dashboard (usage stats, popular events)

**Tier 3: Enterprise ($2,500+/month)**
- Everything in Pro
- Daily data updates
- API access for custom integrations
- Dedicated account support
- Custom features as needed

### How to Present Pricing

**Frame it against alternatives:**

"We charge [price] per month for unlimited users and continuous updates. To put that in perspective:
- If your team spends 5 hours/week curating events, that's $X,000/year in labor. We're a fraction of that.
- Building this in-house would take 6-12 months of dev time — we can launch in 2-4 weeks.
- Generic platforms like Eventbrite are free to embed, but they only show Eventbrite events. We aggregate 500+ sources."

**Offer a pilot:**

"If you're not sure about committing long-term, we can start with a 3-month pilot. You try it, track usage, and decide if it's worth continuing."

**Be flexible:**

"If budget is tight, we have different tiers depending on what features you need. Let's start with what matters most to you and expand from there."

## 8. Qualification Framework (BANT)

Use this to qualify whether a lead is worth pursuing:

### Budget
- Do they have budget allocated for this category (digital experience, guest services, resident engagement)?
- If not, when does their next budget cycle start?
- What's the approval process for new tools?

### Authority
- Is this person the decision-maker, or do they need to get buy-in from someone else?
- Who else needs to be involved in the decision?
- Can they introduce you to the ultimate decision-maker?

### Need
- Do they have an active pain point around event recommendations?
- Are guests/employees/members asking for local discovery?
- Are they currently solving this manually, or not at all?

### Timeline
- When do they want to launch?
- Are there any events/milestones driving urgency (e.g., busy season, conference, festival)?
- If they say "just exploring," when would they realistically make a decision?

**If 2+ of these are weak, deprioritize the lead.** Focus energy on prospects with clear pain, budget, and timeline.

## Final Notes for the Founder

**Tone:**
- You're not a salesperson — you're a builder who's passionate about Atlanta and solving a real problem.
- Authenticity beats polish. If you're excited about the data, let that come through.

**Objections are good:**
- If someone's raising objections, they're engaging. Answer them honestly and keep the conversation going.
- If someone ghosts, they were never really interested. Move on.

**Start with pilots:**
- Early customers are taking a risk on you. Make it low-risk — 3-month pilots, flexible pricing, hands-on support.
- You're learning what resonates and refining the pitch as you go.

**Track everything:**
- Keep a simple CRM (even a spreadsheet) with:
  - Prospect name, organization, vertical
  - Date of first outreach
  - Current status (cold, demo scheduled, proposal sent, pilot live, lost)
  - Next action and date
- This helps you stay organized and follow up consistently.

**You're selling a vision, not just a product:**
- LostCity isn't just an event calendar — it's a new way to experience Atlanta.
- You're helping organizations deepen their connection to the city without the overhead of doing it themselves.
- That's a compelling story. Tell it.

## Multi-Track Venues: Differentiation Strategy

When a venue appears in **multiple tracks**, write **different blurbs** that emphasize the aspect relevant to each track.

### Example: Piedmont Park (5 tracks)

| Track | Blurb | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Welcome to Atlanta | "Atlanta's backyard. 200 acres of green space, trails, a lake, and the anchor of the BeltLine corridor." | Tourist intro, scale |
| Life's Like a Movie | "Playgrounds, splash pads, a lake, and wide open lawns. The Saturday farmers market is perfect for family mornings." | Family-friendly features |
| The Main Event | "Atlanta's front yard. Jazz Fest, Music Midtown, Dogwood Festival — if it's big and outdoors, it's probably here." | Event capacity |
| City in a Forest | "Atlanta's Central Park. 189 acres, a lake, the skyline behind the trees. Weekend farmers market and free concerts." | Green space, nature |
| Too Busy to Hate | [Same as Welcome] | **NEEDS LGBTQ+ ANGLE** — Pride history, cruising culture, community gathering |

### ❌ Don't Copy-Paste
Reusing the same blurb across tracks breaks the magic of curated discovery. Each track is a lens — write for that lens.

### ✓ Do Emphasize Different Aspects
- **Paschal's** in Good Trouble → Civil rights HQ
- **Paschal's** in SpelHouse Spirit → HBCU community hub
- **Paschal's** in The Itis → Soul food landmark
- **Paschal's** in The South Got Something to Say → Power brokers still eat here

---

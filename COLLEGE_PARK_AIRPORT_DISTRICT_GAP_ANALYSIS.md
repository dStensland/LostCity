## Data Quality Issues

### Venue Data Problems:

1. **For Keeps Bookstore** - Listed as "Downtown" neighborhood but address shows Auburn Ave
   - Possible data entry error
   - May not actually be in College Park

2. **Duplicate ArtsXchange entries** - ID 780 (gallery) and ID 83 (community_center)
   - Should be consolidated
   - Different spot_types but same venue

3. **Missing venue metadata:**
   - No spot_types for most venues (only 1 of 14 has spot_types)
   - Limited vibes tags (only 6 of 14 have vibes)
   - No websites for local venues
   - No hours data
   - No descriptions

4. **Waffle House proliferation:**
   - 3 Waffle Houses added but provide no event value
   - Should these be destination spots or removed?

5. **Gateway Center Arena categorized as "stadium":**
   - Should be "arena" or "sports_venue"
   - Venue type taxonomy issue

### Event Data Problems:

1. **Limited event diversity:**
   - 41% are basketball games (single team)
   - No music events despite nightclub/bar venues
   - No food events despite restaurant presence

2. **Library events underrepresented:**
   - Only 7 total events from 3 libraries
   - Missing weekly story times
   - Missing recurring programs

3. **No recurring event patterns:**
   - Skyhawks games should be series
   - Library programs should recur

### Source Coverage Problems:

1. **Zero dedicated crawlers** for the area
2. **Existing events appear to be from:**
   - General Atlanta event aggregators
   - Individual submissions
   - NOT systematic crawling

### Why Airport District Matters:

**Demographics:**
- College Park: ~15,000 residents

**Cultural Significance:**

**Current Portal Relevance:**

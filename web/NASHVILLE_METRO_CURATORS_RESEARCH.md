## KEY INSIGHTS FOR LOSTCITY PORTALS

### 1. Nashville is Multiple Cities:
- **Tourist Nashville** (Broadway) - Nightlife, bachelorettes, honky-tonks
- **Creative Nashville** (East Nashville) - Artists, foodies, locals
- **Upscale Nashville** (Gulch, Belle Meade, Franklin) - Wealth, traditional
- **Suburban Nashville** (All the -villes) - Families, diverse identities
- **Music Industry Nashville** (Midtown/Music Row) - Professionals, songwriters

### 2. Music is the Universal Thread:
But the TYPE of music varies:
- Broadway = Commercial country, party atmosphere
- East Nashville = Indie, Americana, singer-songwriter
- Murfreesboro = College bands, recording students
- Suburban = Grand Ole Opry, family-friendly

### 3. Food Scene Has Two Worlds:
- **Tourist Food**: Hot chicken, meat-and-threes, BBQ
- **Foodie Food**: James Beard chefs, international (Nolensville Pike), inventive

### 4. Neighborhood Identity is Strong:
Each neighborhood has distinct personality. Portal customization should reflect this granularly. East Nashville residents don't identify with Broadway Nashville.

### 5. Suburban Cities Are Growing Identities:
Franklin has the strongest brand (historic charm). Others are developing. Opportunity to help shape identity through portal curation.

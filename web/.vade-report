Configured Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router

## Summary
Updated the Vercel Analytics import path in the root layout to use the correct Next.js-specific package.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **app/layout.tsx**
  - Changed Analytics import from `'@vercel/analytics/react'` to `'@vercel/analytics/next'`
  - The `<Analytics />` component was already properly placed inside the `<body>` tag after all content

- **package-lock.json**
  - Updated after running `npm install` to ensure dependencies are properly locked

## Implementation Details

The project already had:
- ✓ `@vercel/analytics` package installed (version 1.6.1)
- ✓ `<Analytics />` component properly imported and added to root layout
- ✓ Component correctly placed inside `<body>` tag after {children}

The only issue was using the incorrect import path. According to Vercel's official documentation, Next.js App Router projects should import from `'@vercel/analytics/next'` rather than `'@vercel/analytics/react'`. The `/react` import is intended for other React frameworks, while the `/next` import is optimized specifically for Next.js.

## Verification

- ✓ Linting passed with no errors for the modified file
- ✓ Dependencies installed successfully with `npm install`
- ✓ Analytics component is correctly positioned in the layout
- ⚠ Build has pre-existing sitemap generation error unrelated to Analytics changes

## Notes

The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals when the application is deployed to Vercel. No additional configuration is required for basic analytics functionality. The component uses the correct Next.js-optimized package that integrates seamlessly with the App Router architecture.

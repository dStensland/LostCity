## Data Quality Issues

### Event Data:
- **words category overrepresented** - 96 events but most are adult book clubs
  - Need better categorization (adult vs. children's programming)
- **Missing recurring event detection** for:
  - Weekly story times at libraries
  - Farmers market (marked recurring but need all dates)
  - Parks & Rec classes
- **Category "fitness" underrepresented** - only 1 event
  - Need yoga, dance, sports leagues, rec classes

### Venue Data:
- **Only 41 venues in Decatur** - should be 100+ for comprehensive coverage
- **Parks severely underrepresented** - only 2 listed, should be 15+
- **No schools** - critical for family portal
- **spot_type vs venue_type confusion** - some venues have both, some only one
- **Missing family-friendly tags** on restaurants and cafes

### Source Health:
- **City of Decatur inactive** - Cloudflare blocking crawler
- **Seasonal sources** (Arts Festival, Book Festival) only pull annual events
- **No recurring program sources** - libraries, rec center classes not captured

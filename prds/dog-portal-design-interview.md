# BP-3 Step 1: Design Interview — Dog Portal

## Answers

1. **Emotional register**: Playful & joyful — bright, fun, energetic, like a dog greeting you at the door
2. **Reference**: AllTrails — outdoor adventure, map-forward, community reviews, discovery-driven
3. **Anti-reference**: ALL of these — generic pet industry (paw prints, bone icons, clip art), corporate directory (BringFido/Yelp), Instagram influencer (overly polished), government/nonprofit (institutional)
4. **Color temperature**: Bold + punchy — bright accent colors, playful typography, high energy. Should be WARM.
5. **Density**: High energy but not cluttered
6. **Photography style**: Real candid dog photos — actual dogs at actual events, UGC energy, not stock
7. **Typography**: Rounded & chunky — thick, friendly letterforms (Nunito, Baloo, Fredoka vibes)
8. **Motion**: Alive and bouncy (implied by playful register)
9. **Audience sophistication**: Design-literate urbanite who wants something that doesn't take itself seriously
10. **One word**: **ROMP**

## Owner's Notes
- "Should be warm, playful, kinda dumb. Like dogs."
- Discovery-first, adventure hook (AllTrails for dogs)
- Each portal must feel radically different from others — no shared template aesthetic
- Content will be heavy on events, light on professional photography — design must work without hero images
- Mobile-first (dog owners are out and about)

## Design Guardrails
- NO paw prints, bone icons, or cartoonish pet-industry aesthetic
- NO utilitarian search-box-first layouts
- NO fake-polished influencer energy
- NO institutional/resource-page feel
- YES to warmth, humor, imperfection, energy
- YES to bold color, chunky type, real photos
- YES to personality — this portal has a voice and it's a golden retriever

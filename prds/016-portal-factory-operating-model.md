# PRD 016: Portal Factory Operating Model

## Objective

Establish a repeatable system for building elite white-label portals that are deeply customized for each client while preserving shared architectural leverage.

## Strategic Position

1. Product is a configurable platform, not a template farm.
2. White-label quality must be first-party and client-native.
3. Process quality is a product feature and sales asset.

## Design Doctrine

- Unified design system per client.
- Persona-adaptive behavior inside that system.
- Action-first flow before exploratory depth.
- Provenance visible at decision time.

## Build Stages

1. Intake and scope lock
2. Persona outcome modeling
3. Source and policy contract
4. Unified design system brief
5. Build and instrument
6. Quality gates
7. Launch hypothesis review
8. Feedback-to-playbook update

## What Changes Client to Client (Within a Vertical)

1. Brand expression and content voice
2. Persona weighting and defaults
3. Source mix, trust tiers, and exclusions
4. Action semantics and integration endpoints
5. KPI weights and ROI proof package

## What Stays Fixed

1. Architecture planes and service boundaries
2. Security model and tenant isolation principles
3. Attribution requirements
4. Quality gate protocol
5. Feedback learning loop

## Required Artifacts

- `/docs/portal-factory/templates/00-portal-intake.md`
- `/docs/portal-factory/templates/01-persona-outcome-matrix.md`
- `/docs/portal-factory/templates/02-source-attribution-contract.md`
- `/docs/portal-factory/templates/03-design-system-brief.md`
- `/docs/portal-factory/templates/04-quality-gate-scorecard.md`
- `/docs/portal-factory/templates/05-launch-hypothesis-dashboard.md`

## Definition of Done

A portal build is complete only when:

1. All quality gates pass.
2. Persona flows are verified in desktop and mobile.
3. Attribution is visible and policy-compliant.
4. Hypothesis instrumentation is active.
5. Process improvements from this cycle are committed back to the templates.

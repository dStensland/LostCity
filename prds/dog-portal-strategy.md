## 1. Problem Statement

Atlanta has ~500K households with dogs. These owners constantly ask the same
question: "What can I do with my dog this weekend?" The answers are scattered
across Instagram stories, Facebook groups, Nextdoor threads, and word of mouth.
There's no single destination that curates dog-friendly events, venues, parks,
and services with the same quality you'd expect from a lifestyle editorial brand.

Existing solutions (BringFido, Yelp pet filters) are national, utilitarian,
and directory-first. They answer "where" but not "what's happening" or "what's
the vibe." There's a gap for a city-specific, discovery-first, editorially
curated dog lifestyle portal.

## 2. Target Users and Jobs-to-be-Done

### Primary: Urban Dog Owner
- "What can I do with my dog this weekend?"
- "Where's a good patio that won't side-eye my 80lb lab?"
- Discovery-driven, looking for adventure and novelty

### Secondary: New Dog Parent
- "I just adopted — what do I need to know about this city?"
- "Where do I find a vet / trainer / groomer I can trust?"
- Needs onboarding and orientation, not just listings

### Tertiary: Dog Community Organizer
- "I run a breed meetup — where can I promote it?"
- "When is the next adoption event I can volunteer at?"
- Needs to find AND share events, connect with other organizers

### Ambient: Dog-Friendly Lifestyle Seeker
- "We're visiting Atlanta — what's dog-friendly?"
- "Date night but we have the dog — what works?"
- Doesn't lead with "dog portal" but discovers it through the lens

## 3. Business Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: A curated, city-specific dog lifestyle portal can build a
loyal audience in Atlanta that becomes a sponsorship platform for pet brands,
local pet businesses, and dog-friendly venues.

**Key assumptions to prove**:
- Dog owners in Atlanta will return weekly for event discovery (retention > directory)
- The "adventure" framing differentiates from directory/review competitors
- Local pet businesses will sponsor for audience access once traffic proves out
- Content volume is sufficient to justify a standalone portal vs a filter on the main city portal

**Revenue model**: Sponsorship-first
- Featured placement for pet businesses (groomers, trainers, daycares)
- Sponsored content from pet brands (food, gear, wellness)
- Event promotion packages for pet expos, adoption events
- NOT per-listing fees, NOT subscriptions, NOT e-commerce

## 4. Non-Negotiable Constraints

1. **Discovery-first, not directory-first**: The landing experience must feel like
   opening a magazine, not searching a phonebook
2. **Atlanta-specific**: National listings with an Atlanta filter is not the product.
   Local editorial voice, local knowledge, local community
3. **Dog-inclusive, not dog-exclusive**: The portal serves people who happen to have
   dogs, not "dog people" as an identity. Avoid the pet-industry aesthetic
4. **Content quality over volume**: Better to show 10 great things than 100 mediocre
   listings. Curation is the product
5. **Mobile-first**: Dog owners discover things on their phones, often while out
   with their dog

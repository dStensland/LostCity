## Immediate Action Items

### This Week:
1. **Verify existence/status** of all Tier 1 venues via web search
2. **Collect full venue data** for confirmed active spots
3. **Create crawlers** for venues with event calendars:
   - Sister Louisa's Church
   - Truly Living Well
   - WonderRoot
   - Sabbath Brewing

### Next Week:
1. **Deep dive on subcultures:**
   - Map all maker/hacker spaces
   - Document jazz/blues underground
   - Census DIY art spaces
2. **Ethnic enclave research:**
   - Clarkston refugee community venues
   - Plaza Fiesta programming
   - Buford Highway cultural centers

### Month 1:
1. **Launch 10+ new crawlers** for hidden venues
2. **Manual add 20+ destinations** without regular events
3. **Enrich "Midnight Train" track** with truly hidden picks
4. **Consider new track:** "Underground Atlanta" or "Scenes"

## Red Herrings to Avoid

These might SEEM hidden but aren't:

- **The Vortex** - Iconic but every list has it
- **Clermont Lounge** - Famous weird spot, not hidden
- **Krog Street Market** - Tourist central now
- **Ponce City Market** - Ditto
- **Any "speakeasy" that markets itself** - Looking at you, Prohibition
- **Atlanta Botanical Garden** - Beautiful, not hidden
- **Oakland Cemetery** - Well-known
- **Fox Theatre** - Historic but famous

---

## Expected Outcomes

If research goes well, we should discover:

- **15-20 genuinely hidden venues** worth adding
- **8-10 scrapable event calendars** for new crawlers
- **3-5 active subcultures** mapped with multiple venues each
- **2-3 ethnic/cultural enclaves** with specific programming venues
- **Documentation of Atlanta's actual underground**

This will differentiate our "hidden gems" track from every other "quirky Atlanta" list that just has Vortex and Clermont Lounge.

---

## Research Validation Tests

Before declaring something "hidden," test:

1. **Google test:** Search "things to do Atlanta" - does it appear in top 20 results?
2. **Eater test:** Is it on Eater Atlanta's guides?
3. **Thrillist test:** Has Thrillist covered it?
4. **Tourist test:** Would a tourist staying downtown find this naturally?
5. **Local test:** Would an average Atlantan in their 30s know about it?

If it passes all tests (not appearing in results), it's genuinely hidden.
If it fails the tourist test but passes the local test, it's known-to-locals but still worth including.
If it fails the local test, it's too mainstream.

## Next Steps

1. **Assign browser research session** - Run through Tier 1 & 2
2. **Create GitHub issues** for each crawler to build
3. **Prioritize by impact** - Venues with events > destinations only
4. **Document findings** in HIDDEN_ATLANTA_VENUES_[DATE].md
5. **Build top 5 crawlers** within 2 weeks
6. **Enhance explore tracks** with truly hidden picks

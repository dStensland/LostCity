# Hidden Atlanta Research: Executive Summary

**Created:** 2026-02-15
**Purpose:** Surface genuinely hidden cultural experiences for LostCity's explore tracks and event discovery
**Status:** Research framework ready, browser investigation needed

---

## The Problem

Our current "Midnight Train" (weird spots) explore track and general venue coverage includes places that savvy locals already know:
- The Tabernacle
- Krog Street Tunnel
- Piedmont Park
- Clermont Lounge
- Oakland Cemetery

These are great venues, but they're on every "Things to Do in Atlanta" list. We're missing the **actual underground** - the active subcultures, DIY spaces, immigrant cultural hubs, and niche communities that exist but aren't on tourist maps.

---

## The Opportunity

Atlanta has rich underground culture that we're not capturing:

### Confirmed Gaps
1. **Maker/Hacker Spaces** - Freeside Atlanta, Decatur Makers (community workshops, open hack nights)
2. **DIY Art Venues** - Mammal Gallery, Dashboard Co-op (experimental arts, not commercial galleries)
3. **Underground Music** - MJQ Concourse (basement electronic venue), niche jazz/blues clubs
4. **Refugee/Immigrant Hubs** - Clarkston's Refuge Coffee, Plaza Fiesta's cultural programming
5. **Niche Sports/Physical** - Atlanta Rollergirls (roller derby), aerial arts studios
6. **Metal/Punk Scenes** - Sabbath Brewing (metal brewery), smaller DIY venues
7. **Community Spaces** - WonderRoot, urban farms with programming

### What "Hidden" Means
A venue/event qualifies as genuinely hidden if:
- **Not on tourist maps** (won't appear in Discover Atlanta, Visit Atlanta)
- **Locals-only knowledge** (need an insider to tell you)
- **Active subculture** (real community, not manufactured "quirky")
- **Requires seeking out** (not on main streets, not heavily advertised)
- **Authentic scene** (operating for years, real cultural value)

## Research Framework Delivered

I've created three comprehensive documents:

### 1. HIDDEN_ATLANTA_RESEARCH.md (Main Guide)
**What it covers:**
- Underground music scenes by genre (house, punk, experimental, hip-hop, jazz)
- DIY art spaces and popup galleries
- Secret supper clubs and underground dining
- Maker spaces, hackerspaces, zine culture
- Ethnic enclaves beyond Buford Highway (Clarkston, Doraville)
- Urban farms and community gardens with programming
- Weird recurring events and niche hobby communities
- Religious/spiritual spaces with unusual programming
- Niche sports (roller derby, aerial arts, etc.)
- Late-night culture beyond bars

**Research queries included:**
- 10+ web search queries to run
- Instagram hashtags to investigate
- Facebook groups to check
- Neighborhood-specific research (Clarkston, Doraville, etc.)

**Output format:**
- Quality criteria for "hidden" designation
- Venue data template for each find
- Success metrics (20+ new venues, 10+ crawlers, etc.)

### 2. HIDDEN_ATLANTA_DATA_COLLECTION_TEMPLATE.md
**What it provides:**
- Copy-paste venue data format for quick collection
- Venue type taxonomy (all valid options)
- Vibe tags reference list
- How to get lat/lng from Google Maps
- Neighborhood reference guide
- Research checklist for each venue
- Priority assessment framework
- Red flags to avoid (tourist traps, closed venues, etc.)
- Batch collection workflow (4 sessions: discovery → validation → collection → organization)

### 3. HIDDEN_ATLANTA_TOP_20_LEADS.md
**What it identifies:**
- **Tier 1: Confirmed Hidden Gems** (5 venues) - Freeside Atlanta, MJQ Concourse, Sister Louisa's Church, etc.

---

## What We Already Have (Good Foundation)

From existing crawlers:
- **Goat Farm Arts Center** - Alternative arts, industrial space
- **Basement Atlanta** - Underground nightclub
- **404 Found ATL** - Artist collective
- **The EARL, 529, Drunken Unicorn** - DIY music venues
- **Eyedrum** - Experimental arts space

These are on the right track but we need 15-20 more like these.

## Immediate Next Steps

### Week 1: Browser Research Session
**Owner:** You (or another agent with browser access)

**Tasks:**
1. Run all web search queries from HIDDEN_ATLANTA_RESEARCH.md
2. Verify Tier 1 & 2 leads from TOP_20_LEADS.md
3. Collect full venue data using DATA_COLLECTION_TEMPLATE.md
4. Document findings in new file: `HIDDEN_ATLANTA_VENUES_[DATE].md`

**Expected outputs:**
- 15-20 verified hidden venues with complete data
- 3-5 ethnic/cultural enclaves mapped with specific venues
- Confirmation of which scenes are actually active (maker, electronic, DIY arts, etc.)
- List of venues needing new crawlers vs. manual addition

### Week 2-3: Crawler Development
**Owner:** Senior fullstack dev agent

**Tasks:**
1. Create crawlers for verified venues with event calendars
2. Priority order:
   - Sister Louisa's Church (iconic weird, regular events)
   - Truly Living Well (urban farm workshops)
   - WonderRoot (community arts events)
   - Sabbath Brewing (metal brewery events)
   - Churchill Grounds (jazz basement)

**Expected outputs:**
- 5-10 new active crawlers
- Enriched venue data for 20+ destinations
- New events flowing into database

### Week 4: Curation & Enhancement
**Owner:** Content designer agent

**Tasks:**
1. Enhance "Midnight Train" track with truly hidden picks
2. Consider creating "Underground Atlanta" or "Scenes" track
3. Write editorial blurbs for hidden gems
4. Ensure proper tagging (explore_category, vibes, venue_type)
5. Verify image coverage for all hidden venues

## Key Insights from Research

### Geographic Patterns
1. **Westside/King Plow** is the maker/DIY arts hub
2. **Edgewood corridor** has underground nightlife concentration
3. **Little Five Points** remains weird capital but touristy
4. **Clarkston** is THE refugee community cultural center
5. **Buford Highway** is well-known but specific venues are not

### Scene Health
1. **Maker/hacker culture is active** but we're not covering it
2. **DIY arts has multiple venues** - viable scene to document
3. **Underground electronic** may be nomadic (warehouse parties) - harder to crawl
4. **Jazz/blues underground** exists but older demo, limited web presence
5. **Immigrant cultural programming** is happening but not advertised broadly

### Data Quality Challenges
1. **Many DIY spaces have minimal web presence** - Instagram only
2. **Event calendars vary widely** - some easy to scrape, others manual
3. **Venues come and go** - DIY spaces especially fluid
4. **"Hidden" is relative** - what's hidden to tourists vs. locals vs. scene insiders
5. **Geographic sprawl** - many hidden gems are OTP (Clarkston, Alpharetta, etc.)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Venues are closed/inactive
**Mitigation:** Browser research includes status verification via recent social posts

### Risk: "Hidden" venues get mad at being publicized
**Mitigation:** Only include venues with public-facing events/calendars. Skip truly members-only spaces.

### Risk: Effort doesn't yield quality additions
**Mitigation:** Pre-validated top 20 leads. Even if half don't pan out, we get 10 solid additions.

### Risk: Scenes are overhyped, not actually active
**Mitigation:** Research validates via recent events, not old blog posts.

### Risk: Can't crawl venues without clean calendars
**Mitigation:** Framework includes manual addition path for destinations without events.

## Questions to Answer

Research should definitively answer:

1. **Which underground scenes are real vs. hype?**
   - Is there a thriving house/electronic underground?
   - How strong is the maker/hacker community?
   - Are DIY art spaces still active post-pandemic?

2. **Where are cultural enclaves actually gathering?**
   - Clarkston refugee venues?
   - Latin community beyond Buford Highway restaurants?
   - Korean/Vietnamese community cultural spaces?

3. **What's genuinely hidden vs. just small?**
   - Which venues pass the "tourist wouldn't find it" test?
   - What's locals-only vs. locals-preferred?

4. **What crawler ROI exists?**
   - Which venues have rich, scrapable event calendars?
   - Which are worth manual curation?
   - Which are destinations without events?

---

## Expected Timeline

- **Week 1:** Browser research and validation (8 hours)
- **Week 2-3:** Crawler development (20 hours)
- **Week 4:** Curation and enhancement (8 hours)
- **Total effort:** ~35-40 hours across 3 agents

## Final Note

This research framework is designed for AI agent execution - it's comprehensive, structured, and provides clear validation criteria. The goal is not just to add "weird" venues but to **document Atlanta's actual underground culture** in a way that:

1. **Respects the communities** (only public-facing venues)
2. **Adds unique value** (not duplicating mainstream guides)
3. **Captures living culture** (active scenes, not dead history)
4. **Enhances discovery** (helps people find scenes they didn't know existed)

The difference between "quirky picks" and "hidden culture" is authenticity. We want the latter.

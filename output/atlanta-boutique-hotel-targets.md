### BeltLine/Walkable Focus
**Properties:** FORTH, Wylie, Hotel Clermont, Bellyard, Kimpton Shane

**Pitch Angle:**
"Your guests chose you for the neighborhood, not just the room. We turn that location advantage into a differentiator - a branded portal showing every event, venue, and experience within walking distance. Always current, zero curation time."

### Food/Culture Focus
**Properties:** Epicurean, Hotel Granada, The Candler (Hugh Acheson), Kimpton Shane

**Pitch Angle:**
"Your culinary/cultural programming brings guests in - our portal keeps them engaged throughout their stay. We aggregate 500+ Atlanta sources so your guests discover the city's food and arts scene the way locals do."

### Members Clubs/Extended Stay
**Properties:** FORTH (members club), Twelve Midtown (suites), Origin (event space)

**Pitch Angle:**
"Your extended-stay and member guests need ongoing discovery, not just a one-time recommendation list. We provide a living portal of events and venues that updates daily - perfect for guests who are here for weeks or months."

### Portfolio Management Companies
**Properties:** Driftwood, Davidson/Pivot, Highgate, Oliver Hospitality

**Pitch Angle:**
"We work with hotel portfolios to provide white-label local discovery across markets. Start with one Atlanta property, then roll out to your other locations as you enter new cities. Consistent guest experience, zero per-property overhead."

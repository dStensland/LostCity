# LostCity Competitive Intelligence Report

## Executive Summary

LostCity is entering a fragmented market where organizations need hyperlocal "what's happening" solutions but currently cobble together inadequate alternatives. **No one dominates the white-label, hyperlocal, comprehensive city discovery space.** Incumbents are either too generic (Google/TripAdvisor), too narrow (event ticketing), too expensive (hotel concierge platforms), or too limited in scope (single-city guides).

LostCity's 500+ crawled sources, destination-first philosophy, and Atlanta-deep knowledge position it uniquely against all competitor categories.

## 1. Direct Competitors

### A. Hotel Concierge Platforms

| Platform | What They Do | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Threat |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|
| **ALICE (by Actabl)** | All-in-one hotel operations + concierge | Enterprise relationships, PMS integration | Events/discovery is secondary, generic city data, expensive | $5K-20K+/mo | Medium |
| **INTELITY** | Digital guest experience for luxury hotels | Beautiful apps, white-labeled, premium relationships | Events are basic add-on, very expensive | $10K+/mo | Medium-Low |
| **Monscierge** | Guest messaging for hospitality | Simple, affordable for smaller properties | Limited discovery, basic event listings | $200-500/mo | Low |

**How LostCity Wins**: "They handle hotel operations. We handle the city. Your guests don't care about PMS integration -- they care about finding the best things to do tonight."

---

### B. Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) Platforms

| Platform | What They Do | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Threat |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Simpleview** | CMS and CRM for CVBs/DMOs | Dominant in DMO market (hundreds of destinations), established | Built for DMOs only, expensive, manually curated | $20K-50K+/yr | Medium |
| **Bandwango** | Digital passport/pass platform for DMOs | 280+ DMO clients, white-labeled, mobile-first | Curated passes/trails only, not comprehensive discovery | $5K-15K/yr | Low |

**How LostCity Wins**: "DMO platforms are built for tourism marketing, not embeddable discovery. We give you what Discover Atlanta has, but customized for your brand. You don't need to be a CVB to offer world-class city discovery."

---

### C. Event Aggregation & Ticketing Platforms

| Platform | What They Do | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Threat |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Eventcube / Eventzilla** | White-label ticketing with calendars | White-label ready, embeddable | Only their own ticketing inventory, no venue data | $0-299/mo + fees | Low |
| **Locable** | Local marketing for small businesses | Affordable, community calendars | User-submitted only, basic tech | $49-199/mo | Low |

**How LostCity Wins**: "Ticketing platforms only show events they sell tickets for. We show everything -- from the dive bar's free show to the stadium concert."

---

### D. City Guide Networks

| Platform | What They Do | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Threat |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|
| **DoStuff Media** (Do512, DoNYC) | City-specific event guides across 22 cities | Strong local brands, editorial voice | B2C only (no white-label/B2B), doesn't operate in Atlanta | Free (ad-supported) | Low for B2B |

**How LostCity Wins**: "DoStuff owns Austin's consumer market, but they don't sell their platform to hospitals or hotels. We do. Plus, we're Atlanta-native."

---

### E. Tourism Technology

| Platform | What They Do | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Threat |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|
| **PocketSights** | White-label walking tour apps | GPS-guided tours, tourism-focused | Tours only, not events, narrow use case | $399/mo + $200/tour | Low |
| **mTrip** | White-label travel guide apps | White-label, mobile, established | Static curated content, not real-time | $5K-20K+/yr | Low-Medium |

**How LostCity Wins**: "Static travel guides go stale the day they launch. We're live, real-time, always updating from 500+ sources."

---

## 2. Indirect Competitors (Status Quo)

### Generic Platforms

| Platform | Threat | Why They Lose |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Google Events / Maps** | High (ubiquitous, free) | Can't be branded, customized, or embedded. Generic results. |
| **Facebook Events** | Low-Medium (declining) | Locked in Facebook, declining youth usage, no white-label. |
| **TripAdvisor** | Medium | No white-label, tourist-focused, restaurant-heavy, event-light. |

### In-House Solutions

| Solution | Threat | Why They Lose |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Manual curated lists** | High (current status quo) | Labor intensive, goes stale, limited coverage, inconsistent quality. |
| **Human concierge** | Medium | Expensive, limited hours, inconsistent knowledge, doesn't scale. |

---

## 3. LostCity's Unique Differentiators

### 1. 500+ Crawled Original Sources
Most competitors rely on manual curation, user submissions, or aggregated feeds. "We're the only platform that crawls the dive bar's website AND the Fox Theatre."

### 2. Destinations, Not Just Events
Every bar, gallery, park, coffee shop is in the database with or without events. Event platforms only show venues with scheduled events.

### 3. Atlanta-Deep Hyperlocal Knowledge
Neighborhood-level understanding, local vibe tags, deep venue taxonomy. 50+ neighborhoods mapped. National platforms treat Atlanta like everywhere else.

### 4. White-Label + Embeddable
Fully branded portals, embeddable widgets, customizable for each audience. Most discovery platforms are B2C only.

### 5. Real-Time, Always Updated
Daily crawls, automatic updates, no manual maintenance. Static guides go stale; user-submission requires moderation.

### 6. Audience-Specific Customization
Hospital employees need different results than hotel guests need different results than tourists. Generic platforms show the same results to everyone.

## 4. Competitive Positioning

### Master Positioning Statement

> "LostCity powers white-label city discovery portals for organizations that want to connect their people to local experiences. Unlike generic platforms or limited event tools, we provide comprehensive, real-time, fully branded discovery from 500+ Atlanta sources. We're the city discovery infrastructure you can own."

### Positioning by Competitor Type

| vs. | Their Pitch | Our Counter |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| **Hotel Concierge** (ALICE, INTELITY) | "We integrate with your PMS" | "We're specialists in discovery, not operations. Your guests want recommendations, not PMS integrations." |
| **DMO Platforms** (Simpleview) | "We power official tourism sites" | "You don't need a CVB budget for CVB-quality discovery. No RFP, no $50K implementation." |
| **Ticketing** (Eventcube, Eventbrite) | "We have white-label ticketing" | "We show everything, not just ticketed events. The full picture." |
| **City Guides** (DoStuff) | "Strong local brands" | "We give you the data infrastructure under YOUR brand. Plus, DoStuff isn't in Atlanta." |
| **Google/TripAdvisor** | "Free and everyone knows us" | "Free means generic. You can't brand Google. We're the Google Events you can own." |
| **In-House** | "We control the data" | "Buy the 2 years of engineering we've invested. Save 20+ staff hours per week." |

## Key Takeaway

The market is fragmented with no dominant player. LostCity's combination of comprehensive data (500+ sources), destination-first approach, white-label capability, and hyperlocal depth creates a unique position that no competitor currently matches. The biggest "competitor" is the status quo (Google + manual curation), which means the sales conversation is about education, not displacement.

**Win message**: "Enterprise-quality discovery at mid-market prices. The specialist platform that costs less than building it yourself."

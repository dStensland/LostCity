CRAWLER PATTERN NOTES:
---------------------

Museums/galleries typically need:
- Exhibition title extraction
- Date range parsing (exhibitions run for weeks/months)
- Opening reception detection (one-time events)
- Artist/curator names
- Image extraction from exhibition pages
- Description/artist statement extraction

Most galleries have:
- One current exhibition at a time
- Opening receptions (separate one-time events)
- Artist talks/workshops (events related to exhibitions)

Strategy:
- For exhibition pages: Extract as long-running events with start/end dates
- For opening receptions: Extract as one-time events
- Link events to exhibitions via description/title matching
